Since 81 percent of accidents are result of human error it puts into perspective the potential savings on accidents when self-driving cars are adopted. Certainly we may see the number of accidents due to self-driving cars rise as they are more widely adopted, however what is important is this number relative to the number of accidents saved by removing the distracted driver. As we continue to develop the technology we should expect the errors to reduce whereas we don't necessarily see drivers improve over time.
Con: Many individuals are resistant to allowing the car to take over and putting themselves at danger for risks they cannot control. I felt this was an interesting point to bring up as it highlights a main issue with many drivers of the loss of autonomy when fully adopting self-driving cars. Many people do enjoy the act of driving but even more so the responsibility of making their own choices behind the wheel. Yes people still get in accidents often from their own error but it seems inherently worse when they are injured without the opportunity to counteract.   ","The topic of self-driving cars is highly debated especially in light of recent event with the death of an Arizona woman at the hands of a self-driving Uber. Those for self-driving cars argue that they reduce the rate of accidents as a result of distracted drivers, improve traffic flow, are cost saving in terms of time and monetary value from insurance, and could allow greater access to transportation for the disabled and elderly. Those against self-driving cars argue the system does not eliminate accidents, that there is a learning curve with the technology, that it would take away profit from other sectors of the economy, and that there are instances in which the technology is not equipped to make a decision. While both sides make valid points, the benefits of adopting a system of self-driving cars rises to the forefront. 

Many people are quick to point out the flaws in self-driving cars but it is still in its infancy and has the ability to develop and improve with time whereas we have not seen that in human motorists over the years. Certainly we may expect the number of accidents by self-driving cars to rise as it is more widely adopted but this number palls in comparison to the number of accidents caused by drivers. Tragedies such as those in Arizona should not happen but unfortunately with nearly 1.3 million people dying in motor vehicle accidents a year and 81 percent of accidents being the result of human error it appears the main culprit is us. As humans we already rely on computers and technology for many daily tasks and self-driving cars are an extension of the innovative mindset our tech fields have embraced. 

Those against also argue that investing in self-driving cars may take away money from other industries and sectors of the economy. Again while self-driving cars may impact the profits of other transportation system, overall the profits from developing and implementing this technology will outweigh the losses. There is a reason many people invest in tech companies as the have become more profitable in the 21st century. Especially with the start-up of new technology, as they industry grows this will demand that more and more jobs be created to replace the ones lost. Also, savings in terms of reduced accidents are astronomical. The U.S. Department of Transportation has assigned a value of 9.2 million for each human life, with savings coming from venues such as healthcare and insurance. There is also the argument that self-driving cars may also save you time as they free up your transportation time to attend to other daily tasks when you do not have to focus on the driving. With more efficient driving the self-driving cars have the potential to decrease driving time and traffic as well.

Though people are still resistant to the idea of self-driving cars it is already in ways being implemented into our driving with features such as autonomous braking, self-parking and sensor detectors. The technology for this field is currently available and calls on our investment to develop and improve. While no system is perfect, one that saves us lives and on costs should be highly considered.

This point shows a real revolution in human transportation as everyone will have an opportunity to reach their destinations in almost any conditions. As the self-driving cars can give more freedom to human, I believe this technology will be accepted soon.
Con: ""A self-driving car doesn't completely eliminate the likelihood of a car accident. In fact, there's no legal precedent for how a case would be handled. The difficult question of who holds responsibility in a car accident- the driver? The car manufacturer? The software developer? Could be tricky to answer."". The technology shows a challenge to lawmakers in all societies when it relates to human's lives. I think this problem need to be solved before self-driving cars can be deployed in mass.","Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and give opportunities to many people who can't travel by themselves at this moment. On the other hand, people also raise concerns about the security, safety, and economy of the technology.
In my opinion, I support bringing self-driving cars into reality. The technology can bring many benefits to humanity. First, we, as human in modern societies, will save a lot of money thanks to the technology. Because when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and they can communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Second, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it can eliminate mistakes made by a human. The most common mistake is driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tireness). Moreover, drivers tend to have false confidence as they have more driving hours. This false confidence will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Last but not least, self-driving cars put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, in many cases, they can only take a person to a pre-designated location (stop) rather than the real destination. Public transportations are operated with a fixed schedule which does not perfectly match everyone's situations. 
The cons about self-driving cars could be categorized into two groups: not-ready and not-true. The not-ready group contains arguments about new challenges that the technology will bring in when it is deployed in mass. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? Or security issues such as how can drivers protect their personal data and what will happen if the car is hijacked by a hi-tech criminal? Interestingly, what would the car-makers or software designers choose in moral-sensitive situations? For example, given an unavoidable accident will happen, which will either kill an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement, which choice should be made by the self-driving car? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. The not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology. For example, there are concerns about drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuffs. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. I use the washing machine at least twice a week without knowing how to make such a machine. Another false opinion is the difference between states regarding turning right on red or cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. In fact, the car can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on GPS signal. Moreover, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, the police officer does not need to go down the street and directs the traffic but just sends information to the car through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs a manufacturer. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more.
In conclusion, I think self-driving car is a revolution that will have more benefit to our society. However, there are still some concerns needed to be addressed in order to make this technology available to everyone.",

The errors come from a wide array of distractions, poor decisions, and oversights. A computer can be designed so as to limit or remove many of these negative factors and minimize the crashes due to error. The point is interesting to me because it appeals directly to the intuition that minimizing harm is, all things equal, an admirable goal.

Con#6: Many people are employed in transportation industries which rely on their driving ability. If a cheaper, faster, and more effective computer was designed, it would likely displace all of these human jobs, leaving many unemployed. This point is interesting to me because it represents a problem which only worsens as the self-driving cars improve and constitutes a real threat to a large number of people.","Self-driving cars, though only recently becoming a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development and have thoroughly captured the public eye. The debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole is raging onward with impassioned argument on both sides. In this essay I will aim to provide convincing evidence that though it is not perfect, the prospect of driver-less roads would mark a definitive improvement over our current conditions. 

To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. Although it is not yet certain that self-driving cars in their current condition would cause that number to go down, the lack of human fallibility makes the prospect seem likely. Furthermore, whereas human driver tend to fall into a lull of false confidence when they have engaged in a task for an extended period of time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. There is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. 

Furthermore, self-driving cars could give society a method of transportation which is much less restrictive. Currently, driving privileges are limited to those capable of operating the machinery, passing their test, and -for the most part - affording to own their own vehicle. If a child needs to be transported to any sort of extracurricular event they are bound by their parents' schedules and mobilities. If a senior citizen who has been deemed unsafe to drive decides to go shopping they must wait for long periods to use public transportation with conditions that could be extremely painful or uncomfortable with those who experience chronic pain from arthritis or similar conditions. Furthermore, many who cannot afford their own car are forced to commute long distances to their jobs, health-care, and programs, forcing a de facto restriction on who may access what. Although it is likely that one who cannot afford a regular car could not afford their own self-driving car, there is nothing to say that they must have their own. The ability to have a car drive back to the place it left from could allow a much more intricate form of car sharing; additionally, the current restrictions on insured drivers that hassle any type of shared vehicle would likely be thoroughly relaxed or missing entirely for a driver-less car. Even beyond the prospect of shared cars, self-driving vehicles could revolutionize public transportation, making a wider range of pick up locations and drop off locations feasible. If large buses or a huge fleet of public cars were to have flexible routes that could give people who do not have the means to own their own car a transportational freedom akin to it at a fraction of the price that services like Uber and Lift offer today. 

A society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine much of their success and failure. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it does not seem to be a stretch to claim that this could bring us dramatic improvements.",
15,4/17/2018 11:48,4/17/2018 13:42,100,6811,TRUE,4/17/2018 13:42,2018argrewrite_4,B,email,EN,I agree,Graduate student,5th year or above,Yes,,3,Extremely confident,,"Writing organization,Strong ideas,Vocabulary choice,Sentence structure,Good evidence,Correct grammar,Strong explanations,Staying focused on my main idea,Clear explanations of my ideas,Strong thesis",Vocabulary choice,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Disagree,,,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,11.263,4125.715,4130.851,9,"Pro #7 suggests that self-driving cars will be able to group together and thereby reduce traffic, drive times, and carbon emissions produced by idling vehicles. I find this to be a solid prospect for the millions of stressed out drivers who sit in rush hour traffic twice a day and appreciate the added boon for the environment.

Con #7 asks who is responsible when technology fails. This is an essential question, because, in a just society, there must be accountability for the failure and justice for the injured party. However, determining fault may be extremely difficult. 
","	There are many advantages for the United States to transition to self-driving cars. The primary benefit is simply the amount of lives saved due to the elimination of intoxicated, distracted, or otherwise dangerous drivers. Computers provide a precise, safe alternative to the potential for human error that occurs each time a driver gets behind the wheel. In addition, self-driving cars can save money on insurance costs and outdated infrastructure, decrease traffic, and are actually better for the environment.  However, some limitations to self-driving cars exist. These include a difficult transition to using these vehicles, cost, the failure of technology, and the potential for job loss and decline of certain industries.
	Frequently, we hear arguments for or against something with the justification that it benefits or does not benefit society.  In order to make an argument for either one of these, it is imperative that we consider the following questions: who is society, what is good for society, what does society need, and at what expense to the individual do we support the public good?
	In this case, the answer to these questions is easy. Anything that has the potential to save human lives is both good for the individual and good for society. Despite the limitations in technology, an initial cost, and a likely challenging transition, self-driving cars are the future, and they will save lives. No other benefit matters. No other limitation should stop us.  
America has a serious, dangerous driving problem. Every year, 33,000 people die in automobile accidents, and most of these deaths should have been prevented because the drivers were distracted, drunk, tired, or simply should not have been driving.  
If that statistic is not sobering enough, consider this. Vehicular accidents are also the number one cause of death for teenagers, again, the majority of which are preventable.  We know from cognitive scientists and psychologists that teenagers are more likely to engage in risky behavior—like dangerous, drunk, or otherwise impaired driving—and, while getting a driver’s license has been a rite-of-passage for a century in America, it’s time to stop the senseless destruction car accidents cause.
Interestingly enough, the Department of Transportation calculated that each person is worth $9.2 million. Like so many things, the government got this one wrong as well. A human life is priceless. Nothing can bring back a loved one who has been killed.
If you have reservations about self-driving cars due of the potential for technological failure, I share them with you. Just this past month, a self-driving car being tested in Arizona turned a corner, struck, and killed a woman who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk. We have not perfected this technology. We have miles to go before it can be implemented on any kind of large scale. We have many ethical, legal, and policy considerations and implications to work through. However, we have the opportunity to save countless lives. We have the opportunity to save countless others from debilitating injury. We have the obligation to use technology the way it’s always been used—to benefit our society and improve the lives of all Americans.

In the list of pros, I agree that self-driving cars can be a benefit to society. Most importantly, parking would improve as there would be less human error and the computer system can find available parking spaces using a GPS system. However, there will still be cons when thinking about self-driving cars as they cannot completely eliminate car accidents. If anything, a car accident involving two self-driving cars would be more of a hassle to settle since the drivers are not at fault and neither are the two cars. ","When Back to the Future I and II were released in the 80's, many people were captivated by the technology showed throughout the films. Even though technology has greatly advanced within the last decade, it still has not reached the status of flying cars and floating hover boards. As we inch closer to 2020, the idea of having such technology does not seem impossible anymore. Olivier Garret stated in a Forbes article that he believed 10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020, and one out of four cars will be self-driving by 2030. Although Back to the Future II predicted cars flying in 2015, the estimate of 2020 for self-driving cars is not that far off. 

Within the past year, companies like Ford, Honda, BMW and Tesla are few among the many automakers that are pushing for self-driving technology. This makes complete sense as technology is on an increasing incline forwards and will continue to do so as long as there is a need for it. Since the idea of self-driving cars is new and there has not been a ton of research on it, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages before getting into an autonomous vehicle. 

Listed here are the highlights of a self-driving car: human error is reduced due to the machine abiding by rules of the state, drivers will no longer be distracted and will be able to multi-task better instead, and transportation overall will be more efficient. Being a supporter of technology and fighting for new innovations, the advantages of a self-driving car outweighs the disadvantages in my opinion. Technological advances are occurring at such a fast pace that automobiles need to adapt and keep up. It is understandable that people are hesitant to this idea, as there are some major concerns that need to be addressed before being implemented. 

Jobs such as driver's ed instructors, DMV tellers and employees of companies like Uber and Lyft, will definitely suffer. As self-driving cars increase, the demand for their jobs will decrease and the unemployment rate will rise. Although this is an important concern, technology failure (i.e. glitches), would be an even greater concern. Accidents could be more fatal and insurance rates might increase to account for that. It would not be surprising if insurance companies created more ""necessary"" packages of coverage for autonomous cars. Instead of purchasing the normal auto insurance, there would be a greater domain for insurance companies to charge for and the limit for them would be endless. Auto insurance companies take tons of money anyway, what is another $200-300 per month? 

Overall, self-driving cars are infiltrating our society at a rather rapid rate. There are many positives and negatives about this advancement, yet there is still a need for more research and answers. As someone who personally hates driving and fears being in an accident, I will gladly take a self-driving car over a regular car any day.",

Even in cities with great public transportation, it continues to be difficult for the disabled to get from point A to point B.

The ability for a car to be hacked is a relevant concern, especially after Atlanta's city government was recently hacked and the city had to go analog. Hacking cars could become a weapon of terrorism and the cars would need the highest level security to keep hackers out.","Self-driving cars are here. They have been piloted in Silicone Valley, San Francisco, New Mexico, Pittsburgh, Moscow, and other places. However, although the technology is here, they are not yet a part of people's lives. The cars are not yet able to drive in all weather conditions or handle anomalous traffic events, like if a storm knocks out traffic lights. Despite these ongoing hurdles self-driving cars have yet to overcome, the training of their neural networks pushes forward because once the technology can be implemented, the cars can solve real-world problems. The cars can make it safe for people with disabilities to run errands without needing to call a friend or a cab. They will reduce the number of traffic fatalities, especially those caused by driver inattention or inebriation. There are plenty of valid concerns about rolling self-driving cars into the market today but tomorrow is another story. Their use will ultimately benefit their passengers and the environment by creating a safer world.

The world is on the brink of environmental disaster. Irreparable damage has already be done, but further harm can be minimized through the advancement of many technologies, self-driving cars are one. Beyond the greater fuel efficiency self-driving cars provide, there is one feature that people do not often consider. Self-driving cars do not need to be owned by an individual. They can be owned by company, such as Zip Car or Uber. Consumers can pay these companies a monthly fee to have a car available to them whenever they need it and they can also opt in to a car pool so that the car picks up others going to the same place they are. Many people drive a car to work and home again, but they do not use the car throughout the day and they certainly don't use it while they are asleep. During times of non-use, the car could be picking up other riders. This would reduce the number of cars on the road, parked on the sides of streets, and adding to the carbon footprint.

There are valid concerns to this. People worry about the loss of jobs associated with self-driving cars as taxi drivers and truck drivers may become a job of the past. However, the job market is constantly evolving. It was not long ago when cars did not exist, ergo these jobs did not exist. The future will bring new fields for people to work in and new streams of revenue. Change is daunting, and many people are nervous about how a world with self-driving cars will function, but there is no question that it will function. People will adapt, as they did to the actual process of driving cars, and the world will be safer for it. ",

I have always been a strong advocate of advancement of technology and have been a passionate driver. When I started driving at an early age of 15-16, it was the curiosity to control a machine, which motivated me to be a quick learner.With growing research in self-driving cars, I feel that human control to the machine is somewhat lost, in my personal opinion, self-driving cars tend to take away that ultimate control of your hands. Though technology can be considered relatively secure, as a human, I feel that lack of control takes the charm away and can also sometimes lead to problems where the path for the self driving car is not perfectly defined.","The growth of technology and machines has been at its panache in the 21st century. Humans have found a way to automate every possible task using the availability of high computing power and highly sophisticated algorithms. Driving has been a passion for some and mundane task for others but it has been an important skill for some time now. In recent time, we have also seen improvement in road infrastructure and that has reduced the overall effort required in driving. Self-Driving cars can eliminate that mundane job which we need to do compute on daily basis. Such technology can help reduce the effort for taxi drivers for whom this more like a job than a passion or a choice. Though I strongly advocate the research in this area, I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles.
Most of us millennials like me started driving at an early age, growing worldwide economy can cheaper cars have helped the gap and luxury to drive a car in recent time. Self-driving cars which can drastically reduce the effort required in driving can be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure and road. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, it has been always been a challenge and will remain so to drive in such remote areas. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the country known for its infrastructure and cars which are a symbol of personal freedom. The United States as per my understanding cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars. The success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such accuracy is not yet available at every location possible. GPS are not very reliable to weather conditions and that indirectly relates to self-driving cars. Such technology relies heavily on the field known as machine learning and algorithms used to train such cars can still not give 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios.
Another major concern involving self-driving cars is that we still need humans who are capable to operate sophisticated technology.  Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology at its best and that is true for many people in the middle age and old age.  Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction and can put the driver into the more dangerous situation.Even if we remove, above concerns, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. The cost involved in implementation, the perfect road infrastructure surpass the expected utility of the complete program. 
Reduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can lead to major issues and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator to understand the issue and can lead to major accidents within seconds due to lack of manual control. Himalayan roads where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of any malfunction.
In conclusion, self-driving vehicles is a great idea but are limited to multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs. Such implementation is not a very feasible idea the grand scale but can be used where we can easily meet all the constraints.

Having a computer behind the helm would reduce these instances as they do not possess the ability to be distracted. Although there are positive outcomes from obtaining a self-driving vehicle they are currently not affordable for the majority of Americans. As it currently sits, some of the technology needed to make these vehicles a success costs upwards of $100,000. What can be found of interest through these two facts is that a price can be set on safety.","Self-driving vehicles will decrease fatalities, shave time off commutes, decrease the amount of money being spent on mass transit, and provide more options of transportation for the disabled. At least one of these options directly relates to each, and every person in a given community. Many issues that plague individuals revolve around transportation. From having to wake up earlier in the day because of an increased workload to compensate for traffic, to getting a call that a loved one was in an accident. The increased amount of self-driving vehicles being adopted by consumers will have a positive correlation with the daily lives of those that do not own them. 
	Currently, the U.S. Department of Transportation has assessed the value of a life at $9.2 million. By way of safer roads through self-driving vehicles being more prevalent, because of factors such as the reduction of human error through computers doing the driving, the amount of money being spent by insurance companies will drive down insurance premiums so they can remain competitive. As these vehicles become more common on the roads the cost to purchase them will go down. Companies will find ways to lower costs through more efficient methods of production, and distribution. The savings of money is then passed down to local, and state governments. Less money will have to be spent on methods of mass transit. City buses, and trains maintenance costs will plummet, and those savings are then passed down to the tax paying citizens of the said cities, and states.
	A caveat of self-driving vehicles is the effect that it will have on some employers. The plentiful amount of vehicles which will transport its occupants will decrease the need for public transportation, and taxi services. Though there may be a reduction in those fields of employment other opportunities will undoubtedly be created. An increased need for engineers, auto mechanics, road repairmen/women, and salespeople will have a profound impact on economies.  
       The supporters, and people that oppose of self-driving vehicles both have valid concerns for their positions. But, if there can be a value put on a human life then isn’t there a way that we can save on those costs by mitigating the instances of death? Self-driving vehicles is the way to make that come to fruition. The constant development of safety measures in the autonomous systems will get better as consumers adopt more of the vehicles. Accounts of drunk, tired, and distracted driving will continuously plummet. Therefore, making the roads safer for us all.",

I feel that this is one of the largest advantages of self driving vehicles, but that it is consistently overlooked.
 
In my opinion, the most interesting ""con"" listed suggests that people that enjoy driving their current vehicles may not buy into the idea of driverless cars.  This is quite interesting, since without buyin, this movement goes nowhere.
","The article ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars"", provides an in depth look into the reasoning of whether or not we, as a society, should adopt self-driving vehicles.  Of the 20 ""pros"" listed, an increase in safety was likely the leading factor, but also included were the benefits in commute times and city travel, the possibility for the driver to do something productive in the time that would otherwise be used for driving, and the idea that elderly or disabled people would be able to ride self-driving cars without worry.  However, in contrast to the advantages listed in the article, the author also offered 20 disadvantages.  Many of these focused on the training involved in learning how to operate it, the high cost, security issues (both personal and cybersecurity), legal ramifications, the fact that a self-driving vehicle will not be able to appropriately respond to all situations and other technical hangups,and the financial implications caused by uprooting an old industry. 

When weighing the ""pros"" and ""cons"" in order to gauge whether adopting self-driving cars would be beneficial to society, it is important to look at the whole picture.  The ""pros"" are all valid, while it appears that many of the ""cons"" can be addressed as the self-driving vehicles further develop.  For example, the high initial cost is cited as a reason against adopting these vehicles.  However, what isn't taken into consideration in this case is the fact that new technologies typically drastically drop in price over a short amount of time.  We often hear the story of the first computers being the size of an entire room and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time.  However, in a few tens of years the price of those computers came down enough that many families could afford them.  I believe a similar situation could occur with the sensor and computer package required in self-driving vehicles.  As a second example, cybersecurity has become a very hot topic recently and appears in the ""cons"" against these vehicles.  However, several very critical pieces of infrastructure are operated and they have been largely protected against cybersecurity attacks.  Take for example remote controlled drones currently in use by the military.  The risk of a cyber attack is definitely present, but the designers have found a way to adequately protect the devices.  Something similar could be done for self-driving vehicles.

Although several more examples supporting the idea that many of the present ""cons"" seen in self-driving vehicle adoption can be corrected in the future, it is unnecessary seeing that they are quite similar.  However, what is important to notice is that all of the ""pros"" do not seem as if they will be changing, even as the vehicles themselves improve.  Therefore I recommend the gradual adoption of self-driving vehicles into society.     ",

One pro that I have gained an understanding for after reading the article is that algorithm. It is very interesting that a computer is actually in control of these cars. These computers have the ability to think more accurate than most human beings especial the elderly and those that suffer psychological problems. One con that I stumbled upon while reading the article is that self-driven cars are so costly that I cannot afford to purchase one, today. As a low income individual I must depend on public transportation to get back and forth from where I am going. ","While reading the article the following advantages and disadvantages where more obvious to me than others. Self-driving cars can decrease the percentage of car crashes. 
According to  The U.S.  Department  of  Transportation the $9,000,200.00 of each human life will result into a major cost  savings of insurance  costs  and healthcare costs associated with accident recovery alone. Self-driving cars can allow the driver to complete other task in the meantime. These cars while make traffic conditions better and eliminate traffic congestion as well. Consequently commute times for drivers in high traffic areas will be decreases and there would be less wasting on gasoline. Larger cities will now be able to provide better transportation to their residents. Taxes would be decreased since there would not be a need of drivers licenses issuance. 
The disadvantages of self driving cars include, the cost of self-driving cars will not be affordable to people who are low income. Without everyone adapting to self-driving cars there will still be a loss of lives, time, and costs. There will be lots of jobs lost in the transplantation sector especially in the areas of freight transportation and taxi drivers. This could have a negative impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. If there is a tremendous amount of rain it can result to serious damage to the laser sensor mounted on the car's roof. Driver's may loss the skill to operate vehicles.
Since there are many advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars I strongly believe that self-driving are becoming more of an advantage than a disadvantage in today’s society. Now I clearly have ab better understanding after reading the article than I had before the article. I am definitely on the side of having self-driving cars. I must construct an argument that is in support of self-driving cars as beneficial to society. Since self-driving cars have been on the market they have gained a lot better mechanics, accuracy, and algorithm. Back in 2008, ten years ago, if I was asked to choose a side of being for or against having self-driving cars on the road, I simply could not decide rather to agree or disagree to be in favor of self-driving cars”. People need to remember that autonomous vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives a year. In 2015, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company said research indicated self-driving cars could reduce traffic fatalities by 90% once fully deployed. According to released stats from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 37,000 people died from motor vehicle crashes in 2016, making it a leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, self-driving cars are the best solution to decrease motor vehicle deaths in today’s society. The fact that self-driving cars can decrease police activity is great. In today’s society a simple traffic law not being followed may result into a serious confrontation with law enforcement. It is all too clear that a simple traffic violation can turn into police brutality, a police shooting, or an unwarranted arrest for an entirely separate violation of the law.

This is particularly intriguing since drivers currently distract themselves with activities like reading, texting, grooming, and even watching dashboard-mounted TV.  A significant ""con"" relates to the security of the technology behind these automated vehicles.  This technology is not only of interest to hackers, as the Guardian suggests, but perhaps to the manufacturers themselves, as we have seen in prominent leaks by Facebook, retailers, and others.","The new technology of self-driving cars is decades in the making in Pittsburgh, with Carnegie Mellon first leading the way in the 1990s.  Since then the city has been a literal testing ground for companies like Uber and Argo AI, with the mayor keen on attracting (and keeping) talent at the forefront of this technology.  Reactions have long been mixed, though, even before a fatal accident in Arizona recently halted Uber automated test drives.  The strong opposition to automated vehicles in the aftermath, however, is somewhat surprising, given how much safer the technology tends to be.  Or, rather, how unsafe human drivers actually are.

A single death at the hands of an automated Uber stopped its vehicle testing, yet eighty-one percent of vehicular accidents are the result of human error.  Those in working in Oakland routinely see that this human error extends to pedestrians and cyclists in addition to human drivers.  Humans lack the reaction time to respond to unexpected changes in scenery, from a pedestrian stepping out onto Forbes to a car swerving abruptly to miss a pothole.  Human drivers are also increasingly distracted, and are choosing to distract themselves with a dizzying array of activities from personal grooming to streaming television.  Self-driving cars also solve the problem of drunk driving, as autonomous vehicles double as designated drivers.  In a city with limited taxi service and practically no commercial designated driving companies, drunk drivers find themselves tempted to drive from the Southside to the South Hills with often destructive consequences.

Accessibility and inclusion are on residents' minds, too, as the city plans to implement a rapid transit system that will make current connections faster but will leave lower income and disabled locals out of the discussion.  Fleets of self-driving cars would not only ferry drunk passengers but others without access to vehicles as well, including those in neighborhoods lacking in public transportation.  Pittsburgh's elderly and disabled, who used to be better served by paratransit services before budget cuts gutted these systems, are especially vulnerable by their lack of access.

The counter to the accessibility argument is, of course, the high cost of self-driving vehicles.  With an initial cost of more than $100,000, there is little overlap between the people who currently rely on public transportation and those who can immediately purchase self-driving vehicles.  Not many car owners could afford a $100,000 vehicle, for that matter.  This is alleviated by two considerations, though.  The cost of this technology will inevitably go down, just like the brand new CDs, Nintendos, and personal computers of our youth.  What is unaffordable now may not be in a few years.  What is less certain, though, is whether the city can shed its car-first mentality and embrace shared self-driving vehicles, a public personal transit system.  ",

This is probably where the driving experience is totally different from what we have ever experienced, with individual drivers making individual decisions based on their immediate surroundings. The idea of cars collaborating to maximize the flow is just amazing.

The con that I find strikingly is the one that points out to possible public rejection of the technology. The merits of automated cars are predicated on the optimistic premise that they will come in large numbers. What if they don't?!","It seems that cars have always been the same: four wheels, a body, a steering wheel. They are ridiculously simple! Compare to the history of bicycles for example. If you happen to have seen those old black and white photographs of early bicycles, you will see a complex evolution, akin to those in biology! Nevertheless, something on the horizon is going to turn everything about cars upside down (well, the cars themselves will probably still remain on their four wheels, though!)

Self-driving cars are already among us fueling the debate over their good and and evil. Proponents of automated cars argue that self-driving cars will eliminate the catastrophic number of fatal car crashes because the cold-blooded machines will not be distracted by music, a passer-by, or be under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The other feature they cite is the possibility for many, or even all, cars in a certain city to communicate with one another to coordinate the speed levels, and red light waits so as to achieve the maximum flow and minimum travel times. Automated cars, they say, will allow for more cars to drive next to each other, due to their precision in maneuvering, and yet lead to less congestion. Another major advantage will be their service to the disabled and elderly people. Once a good proportion of cars on the street become self-drivers, the advocates claim that the whole society will benefit: saving lives, avoiding financial setbacks from car accidents, less fuel consumption, fewer traffic police officers on duty, etc. 

However, the opponents of the technology have some legitimate concerns. In this category there are some superficial and trivial arguments that can be refuted right away. For example, the phobia of a scenario where a car breaks down and the human driver, having forgotten how to drive, has no idea of what to do, leading to chaos in the city cannot be a real argument against self-driving cars. Already today, an average individual has no skill to get a car to start up if it all of a sudden stops in the middle of street. Such a situation rarely disrupts a whole city! Some other arguments question the limits of the technology. What if it snows? What if the road is full of potholes (such as those in Pittsburgh!)? Well, these while valid concerns do not prove the technology insufficient. There are improvements coming every day and all those conditions will be taken care of.

With the obvious criticism of the self-driving cars out of way, we arrive at some deep issues against the technology. On the infrastructure level, there is the problem of providing cyber security to such a delicate network of interconnected software that store and communicate data between cars. If, as Guardian suggests, there is a potential for hackers to manipulate such a system, then it will be a true disaster. Achieving a high level of security while possible could be prohibitively costly, overshadowing any amount of saving on gasoline.

However, the biggest challenge facing self-driving cars is their popularity. The pros listed above all are predicated on the hope that they will come in large quantities. The effect of having cars coordinate their paths will not be felt if they substitute only 2% of all the cars out there. Same holds true for safety. Have you noticed that sometimes, ironically, the safest drivers, are the very cause of some accidents? Imagine a road where the speed limit is 50, but ""everyone knows that it is ok to go 60 (when the police is not around!)"". Then that one guy who sticks to that 50 mph limit is the source of frustration for those behind him/her and a possible danger for everyone involved. Thus, the advantages of autonomous cars will begin to take effect only after a good portion of the society adopts them.

But with the currently high cost of these cars, and the natural public resistance to change, it seems that self-driving cars will, for the coming years, live in the margins, only triggering imagination and debates from time to time. At this point in time, we are just not ready yet to embrace them -- definitely not in large numbers.",

Self-driving cars are operated by computer  technology, which engineers the first stage of ""automatic"" driving, such as autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that alert a driver of nearby obstacles. This catches my attention for several reasons, especially  the wincing experience of parking my vehicle in small spaces.

Among the advantages I appreciate most  is the one I find most highly significant --that this technology affords opportunities for commanding automobile transportation  to individuals who otherwise might not be able to handle the wheel. This includes handicapped people unable to drive for physically, mentally, or emotionally debilitating reasons.  It also includes the elderly, and when we consider that the baby boomers are not  
Artificial intelligence  can detect risky situations, being alert to possible perils such as  objects which might be  entering the driver's immediate field. The driver of the self-driving car   doesn't need to worry about emergency situations such as autonomous braking, for example,  because the computer has the intelligence to follow the necessary steps in order to  make the decision to stop the car ""on a dime.""  
Perhaps the most advantageous skill in the self-driver's arsenal is parking the vehicle since in today's world, parking spaces are becoming  fewer and smaller, with less room all the time.The nervousness and uncertainty which accompanies the thought of or the need to park while shopping or performing other chores  can be remedied when the computer takes the wheel. There should be little stress when one sits back and appreciates the work which the computer has been programmed to do.
On the other hand I am  not at all comfortable with  submitting the full power of driving my car to a computer.  It is entirely possible for a computer to malfunction, and this occurrence would put  not only the driver at risk, but other occupants of the vehicle as well as unsuspecting pedestrians. .
 A malfunctioning computer might create a more dangerous  situation than if the driver were manning the vehicle himself. My distrust stems from an experience I remember from my younger life.  The blockbuster movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey, highlighted the use of computers in conducting all of the affairs of the ship.  The human mastermind suspected that the computer was malfunctioning and would need to be shut down or put out of commission. Unfortunately, even though the captain of the spacecraft was careful to not allow the computer to be within earshot of the conversation he'd had with one of the crew, the computer saw the 2 speaking, and the computer was able to read their lips, thus being tipped about the nature of their distrust. Then the computer began plotting ways to extinguish them, so that the computer, who was named Hal, could not be dismantled.
In all probability, robotic intricacies may not be a factor in determining the safety of such cars, but again, the human element can wreak havoc in cases such as hacking where terrorism is the driver!

This idea was most interesting to me because it made me think about how many different tasks I could accomplish on my daily commute to work, if I did not have to worry about driving. The “con” which I found most interesting was the legal and ethical question about who is responsible if (and when) there are accidents. I am interested in imagining scenarios in which either the software developer or the car manufacturer is held responsible for an accident.
","Self-driving cars appear to be the next wave of technology that will impact our lives, following the pattern previously exploited by the internet, cell phones, and other technological advances. The prospect of cars that autonomously drive is an attractive one for a number of positive reasons. One argument for self-driving cars could be that they would reduce car accidents and therefore save lives. 81 percent of car crashes are the result of human error; therefore, it is appealing to think that computer systems specifically designed to combat the issues associated with human error could be good alternatives. By developing specific software algorithms to respond to a myriad of situations and scenarios, self-driving cars appear to have the capability to handle any situation a human driver might encounter. Because self-driving cars would be fully automated to respond to all situations, it is comforting to think that all actions made in response to situations would lead to the best possible outcomes.
	Unfortunately, we still have a way to go before these prospects and visions about self-driving cars can truly be attained. I would like to argue that we need to spend more time considering the legal and moral dilemmas presented by self-driving cars and their actions, and how these differ from the actions taken by typical human drivers. To exemplify a possible situation in which a legal and moral dilemma might arise, I would like to use a twist on the common ethical conundrum posed by the trolley problem. For our purposes, imagine you are sitting behind the wheel of your car and driving down the street. Seemingly out of nowhere, a ball rolls into the street, followed by a child chasing after it. In the moment in which you see the child, you must make a decision as to how you will react. Your two choices consist of either attempting to brake and hope that you stop in time to not injure the child, or swerving the car to the side of the road and risk hitting a tree, thus injuring yourself. As humans in this type of situation, we would be required to react nearly instantly, therefore it is difficult to fault someone for choosing either of these two options. However, because self-driving cars are programmed in advance, we must as a society decide what the best action would be for the car to take. Would the programmer who decides which action the car should take be held responsible if the car is unable to stop in time to prevent injuring the child? Or would the programmer be held responsible if the car swerves and injures the “driver” after hitting a tree? There does not seem to be an easy answer to these questions, however, if we are going to instruct self-driving cars to act in ways that produce the best outcomes, it is necessary for us to decide what this looks like and how it is manifested in various real-world examples.
	With these questions in mind, it is important that we consider the legal and ethical dilemmas resulting from advances in self-driving car capabilities, before we are ready to implement them throughout our society.

The adoption of the self driving class might take a very long time, as there is skepticism regarding the technology. Combined with recent events of road accidents caused by self driving cars, it may take decades to people to adopt and entrust their and loved ones lives to a machine.","Self driving cars may seem too futuristic to believe, but they have become a reality.
They are a symbol of technological advancement we have been able to achieve. They bring with them the hope of increased road safety and awareness. When they become a reality they will improve upon the transportation transportation industry in efficiency and lower costs. Although the huge benefits, self driving cars are still far from reality to be commercialized. They come with huge costs to bear in terms of equipment. The amount of personal information stored in them might make a few people uncomfortable. As well as, self-driving cars will not be able to perform without their sensors in extreme climate conditions.

While there is a lot of skepticism involving self driving cars, I think they will improve road safety and help with accessibility around the United States.

Self-driving cars use highly sophisticated algorithms which calculate appropriate stopping distance and time, this decreases the probability of accidents. We are surrounded by numerous distractions inside the car, such as texting, talking to passengers and sometimes falling asleep at the wheel, all these factors are taken out of the picture once we introduce driverless cars.

We are increase accessibility of reliable and safe transportation to senior citizens and disable drivers with self driving cars. And large cities who lack infrastructure to provide its masses can take advantage of this technology and deploy these cars to remotely connected areas. These cars could also be used to drive around the clock to eliminate the human factor of fatigue.

Self driving cars will decrease cases of road rages and drunk driving incidents, this will allow the police to efficiently use their time in other important cases. As the self driving cars would be electric, this will help reduce pollution caused and would increase efficient usage of power.

There would be less requirement of parking spaces as the cars can drop off people at their destinations and park some place far away. This would also decrease congestion due to parking on the roads.

While designing systems, we always look for an easy interactive system design so that we make full use of the underlying technology and self-driving cars can be no exception to that. Developers of self-driving cars will have mind the compatibility and experience of driving a normal car and design to car to eliminate concerns about extra-special training to handle self driving cars. 

The cost of constructing a self driving car right now seems considerably high, but as computational costs are going down and with government initiatives, incredible technology can be introduced to local masses.",

Also no  more car insurance such a refreshing thought.instead of all these lazy humans looking for the closest parking space to shopping centers, the cars could just drop them off,maybe they would be forced to walk a bit,getting some much needed exercise There are some quirks to figure out but there are some very intelligent educated engineers who would be able to figure the disadvantages of self driving cars.Also legally if there was an accident it would be a human at fault anyway, so that would eventually be worked out. As fas as loss of jobs or displacement there are many job openings in retail,fast foods and nursing homes these workers could all find some sort of employment or they would maybe have to be reeducated. Just think of how cheap goods would be instead of depending on a dumb uneducated truck driver delivering the self driving car would and it could go for 24 hours.Great for the environment less trucks on the road! The educated would be able to afford the cars in the beginning,however as with all technology, the price would come down ,making them more affordable to the masses.also a crippled person could just hop in a self driving car to go to all those doctors appointments.No more of these access buses clogging up our city streets. The smart self driving cars with there algorithums would be perfection,would eliminate accidents,would obey all speed limits ,lights.and stop signs, this would save our cort system so much time and money. We wouldn't be dragged into court for these matters ,and,most exciting we could eliminate the ambulance chasing snake lawyers! So vantages to self driving cars ,save us so much time and money.By the way the infrastructure to operate these cars would create millions of excellent jobs, and everyone would be able to afford a self driving car. I will be waiting in line when they are ready to drive.",

If your car was able to drive itself you would be able to safely complete a secondary task such as getting work done or speaking with a passenger. Individuals who normally would not be able to drive would be able to have a new found mobility that isn't reliant on the public transportation system. Your car would be able to park itself so you would never have to be late to a meeting or appointment. You could have a few drinks out at a bar and not have to worry about how you are getting home. Human error would essentially be taken out of the equation. On the other hand, I also believe that this contributes to one of the most prevalent cons of self-driving cars. If the technology that directs the car were to fail, humans would still need to be able to drive and to make judgement calls on what to do while on the road. For example, imagine a scenario in which you got into your self-driving car while intoxicated. You come to a stop light that is not working but your car doesn't register that there is anything wrong. It blows through the stop light which results in a major car accident that injures several people including yourself. Is this your fault? Your car's fault? The other car's fault? When accidents happen, people want someone to blame. But this situation doesn't lend itself well to a clear cut outlet for that blame. ","  In today's age we are always looking for the 'next thing' in terms of technological advancement. Google is one company that continuously strives to answer that call. Recently they have been doing so by researching the technology for and creating self-driving cars. While this may sound like some futuristic fabrication from Back to the Future, the technology is actually here and being tested even as this piece is being written. 
  Self-driving cars would drastically change our mobility. Human error accounts for about 81 percent of car accidents; if everyone were to transition to self-drivings cars, human error would be eliminated and accidents would be projected to drastically decrease. Traffic patterns themselves would change. The technology in the car would be able to detect its proximity to other cars and adjust its speed and positioning accordingly. This has the potential to make roadways more efficient and commute shorter. One of the most attractive aspects of a self-driving car is the convenience that they provide. The New York Times has suggested that these cars would be a great asset to individuals with disabilities; instead of relying on public transportation they would be able to operate their car as anyone else would. These cars would also be an asset to an individual who wants to get work done in the time it takes to make their commute; they could safely work on a laptop or hold a conversation without having to worry about driving. 
  At this point you're thinking, 'this seems great, sign me up!', right? Well, you might want to re-consider. Self-driving cars sound great in theory but thinking through their practical applications one runs into several road blocks (pun intended). Consider this. A person gets into their car while intoxicated. In theory, this wouldn't be a problem because the car can simply drive itself and the individual can safely ride in the back without endangering themself or others. The car comes upon a traffic signal that is not operating correctly and there is a traffic cop directly the flow of cars. The self-driving car is not equipped to deal with human signals; it does not have human judgement. Instead of being able to over-ride the autonomic function of the car the individual is incapacitated themself and so the car speeds through the signal resulting in an accident where several people are injured. Whose fault is this? The intoxicated individual? The car? The other cars involved? The answer is not clear cut here but the result is the same as if an intoxicated individual had chosen to manually drive the car.
  Humans are not perfect. But then again, neither is technology. Both may have the ability to drive a car but is one really better than the other? My response would be no. A self-driving car is an amazing feat of technology. It is a tool that can be used for many positive purposes and has the potential to change the way in which humans travel. But self-driving cars should only be that: a tool. Humans should still retain the capacity to manually drive a car should the technology glitch and fail for both their safety and the safety of others. ",

As a full-time employee and a part-time graduate student, I appreciate any additional time I can use toward reading, which will help advance my academic and professional careers. However, the security and technology success potential for failure is a major concern. Recently I've experienced a GPS telling me to turn down a road it knows is closed. Additionally, if major websites can be hacked by smart devices like refrigerators, I'd worry about the security of cars. ","As with any new invention, technological or otherwise, there is both major benefits that make the research and development worthwhile and equally major concerns that come from unknown consequences of the new product. For self-driving cars, the benefits are obvious: reducing opportunities for human error on the road, increasing accessibility to those who would be unable to drive manually, improving traffic flow, and saving time. However, all of those benefits come at a high financial cost with several unknown variables such as data security, influence of those drivers not in self-driving cars, potential failures of car or road technology, and legal conundrums. With major companies such as Google investing substantial sums of money into the research and development of self-driving cars, it's apparent that enough people see the benefits eventually outweighing the cost. However, without more conversation about the education that drivers would need to have to successfully operate self-driving cars, driver-less cars will not be as beneficial as some might think.

Though an article in Auto Insurance Center, ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated with Self-Driving Cars,"" lists not needing to go to the DMV to get a specialized driving license as an advantage of self-driving cars, that is clearly not the case. 

As discussed in the ""cons"" section, other sources including Teletrac note that drivers would still have to be trained in how to properly operate the vehicle. Further, if a potential benefit is, as mentioned in the article, that people who can't normally operate cars, such as those who are disable, elderly, or intoxicated, the fact remains that even if trained on how to properly operate a self-driving car, these individuals may not have the physical or mental capacity to manually drive the vehicle.

The article also makes the point that over-relying on the technology could mean that drivers would no longer have the skills to over-ride the system and manually control the vehicle in the event of a failure. Thus, self-driving cars actually require more education: both standard self-driving car operating procedures as well as regular driving training.

With the proper education, one can see the potential benefits mentioned in the article: reduction of distracted driving, more time for other activities while in the car, and travel efficiency.

Increased education may be a mediator of the potential advantages and dangers, but ultimately self-driving cars is a misleading name, as an operator would always have to step in should a system fail within the car or an occurrence of an unusual road condition. Therefore, all stated benefits have their limits, since drivers will need to be paying enough attention to take over in an instant in an emergency situation.

Currently, drivers learn about traffic and road accidents by listening to the traffic radio. With the development of self-driving cars, car-car communications would be more reliable. I look forward to seeing the perfected technology. 

In addition, I found that gasoline industry would suffer very interesting. As an average consumer, I pursue a sustainable lifestyle and desire a lower cost of living. As mentioned in the article, self-driving cars are likely to be electric. Therefore, I am not concerned about the profits of the gasoline industry. ","Many of car accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving. Self-driving cars might not be the answer. 

Equipped with multiple sensors and advanced algorithms, a self-driving car is more likely to be an ideal driver; a self-driving car is more accurate, reliable, and focused than a human driver. However, engineers are still researching the self-driving technology. Many practical questions need be answered. For example, who will  drive the car if the technology fails? This op-ed article will convince you that we should not use self-driving cars. 

First, like human, technology could fail. Who will shoulder the responsibility of driving when the technology fails? We know that there is a big circulating head on top of a self-driving car. It is the “eye” and “ear” of the car. When a human driver is  navigating through a storm, they use their senses to make informed decisions. However, in extreme conditions, the “eye and the “ear” of the car might be damaged. A “blind” driver cannot safely operate a car. In addition, self-driving cars might discourage prospective drivers from attending driver’s education courses. In the case of failed technology, unskilled human operators are not ready to shoulder the responsibility of driving, and there are consequences. 

Who should be responsible for the consequences caused by a malfunctioning self-driving car? When a self-driving car malfunctions, the people inside of the car may not be able to gain control quickly. The time lapsed between a mechanical failure and an attempt to gain control over the car might be long enough to cause an accident. In a court of law, it is very difficult to determine who is responsible in this case. We do not want accidents; we want reliable technology.

Proponents of self-driving cars argue that self-driving cars reduce the cost of driving and alleviate societal burden. On the contrary, the cost of self-driving cars is much high than expected.The research dollars that companies now poured into testings will be paid by the consumers in the long run. In addition, self-driving cars are equipped with sensors that carry a high maintenance and replacement fee. A self-driving car is still a luxury for the general public. The benefits of self-driving cars cannot be reaped if they are not widely used. Additionally, unemployment rates would roar for the transportation industry because machines will replace human labors. The gasoline industry will also suffer immensely since self-driving cars are very likely to be electric.",

This could allow for just an inch of space between cars without the worry of hitting a neighboring car. The cars could also go at the exact same speed without worrying about people needing to pass one another, because it wouldn't be possible and no one would be ""stuck"" in traffic. One interesting con of self-driving cars is that people's personal data could be hacked simply by driving near a person in another car. People tend to be more cautious about their data in internet cafes and places with free wireless internet access, but if a person's car could be hacked, it would make even getting from one place to the next in the comfort of a car a potential hacking risk.","Self-driving cars have beneficial and disadvantageous effects on society. Although the benefits of self-driving cars may seem promising, the adverse effects might deter one from investing in them as the future of automobile technology. First, let’s review the positive side of self-driving cars. 

Self-driving cars would allow parents to feel safer about their high-school children “driving” to school with a reduced risk of speeding or an accident. If their child is distracted by a text, it wouldn’t matter because he/she wouldn’t need to pay attention to the road. If everyone had self-driving cars, there would be much fewer accidents, and speeding would be a thing of the past, allowing police officers more time and manpower to devote to other crimes. These self-driving cars would also benefit the sick and the elderly who would otherwise need to depend on others to get around. 

From an industrial growth prospective, the move toward self-driving cars would promote job growth for minds with a knack for technological advancement and machine learning. A new industry would be created. This can translate to the public transportation sector; self-driving buses and trains may soon follow. 

However, although there are many positives of self-driving cars, as with any technological advancements, there are also risks. Those with self-driving cars may need to worry about keeping their data secure from hackers who may want to know a person’s most frequently visited locations. This data could be used in targeted advertisements, or for more malicious purposes such as ascertaining the best place for a potential robbery or when the home would be empty. In adverse weather or road conditions that would provide the self-driving car with less-clear visual data, there could be a greater risk for an accident. If the occupants of the car do not pay careful attention, they may end up in a car accident. Even more alarming, if a self-driving car is on a slippery road and spins out of control, does it jerk out of the way to save a child pedestrian or the fit male pedestrian? The car wouldn’t know how to make these “gut-feeling” decisions. Additionally, if an accident does happen, where does the blame lie? A car cannot be charged with vehicular manslaughter. If the driver was not technically in control of the vehicle, they may not be responsible either. All that is left is the manufacturing company, however that doesn’t seem appropriate either. New legislation would need to be implemented to account for these possible scenarios.

Whereas some industries may see job growth, public transportation personnel would have a job reduction, as would taxi drivers. The oil and gasoline industries may also suffer, potentially harming export sales from countries that would need it. If these self-driving cars are mostly electric, many gas stations may go out of business. 

Thus, although self-driving cars may provide some benefits to society, the overall risks and potential harm is far greater. People would lose the ability to do things for themselves, others may exploit holes in the technology’s security to harm others, and industries may collapse due to the sudden shift in technology that would ultimately change how the world functions.

In this age of technology individuals are constantly checking their phones for the latest updates on news and social media and they often can check these updates whilst driving a motor vehicle. This distracted driving can be extremely dangerous to all others on the road. The con that I found to be most interesting is the fourth point that hackers may be very interested in these self-driving cars. In a time in which cyber warfare is of great concern it is very reasonable to be worried about potential threats that could infiltrate the systems of these self-driving cars. ","As technology continues to progress at a rapid pace innovators have begun to explore the possibility of self-driving cars. A self-driving car sounds like a child’s fantasy of what a futuristic dystopian society looks like. However, self-driving cars are no longer a fantasy idea, and the impact that these vehicles may have on society is immense. Self-driving cars bring about thoughts of pure leisure while driving. With a self-driving car there is no more need to be stressed out while driving because something else is taking care of all the driving. A self-driving car could help to limit accidents due to the fact that we are taking away the human error aspect of driving. These cars will be programmed to simply avoid accidents and obey all traffic laws. This however is a very idealistic way of thinking. Self-driving cars still bring about their fair share of negative impacts on society. While it may seem that self-driving cars are taking out the human error aspect of driving they are simply replacing it with another opportunity for human error. There is still a strong possibility of human error in the programing of the vehicles. The algorithms could be miscalculated or the technology of the vehicle could be faulty, resulting in a similar dangerousness to an average human driver. That is why it would not be beneficial to society to continue to push for the implementation of self-driving cars. 
	The risks of self-driving cars are to great to overcome when it comes to implementing them into society. One argument for self-driving cars is that they will not be distracted drivers since they will have an algorithm to follow while on the road. While it is true that human drivers face hundreds of distractions while driving they still have some human reactions and instincts that cannot be replicated by a machine. The main concern is the decision making aspects of a self-driving car may in theory sound better than the decision making of an average human; however, a machine can not make up for the judgment of a human being. A scenario in which a self-driving car is driving steadily down the road past a grocery store when suddenly a shopping cart comes directly into its path and it does not have enough time to stop. Algorithms would say that the car would most likely swerve to avoid the shopping cart. But say there is a human being crossing the street right next to the shopping cart. How will the self-driving know that it would be better to brace the impact of the cart and hit that directly while avoiding the human. It is not clear that a self-driving car would have the judgment and instincts to process that decision in a matter of milliseconds. On the other hand, a human would at least be capable of knowing making the conscious decision to avoid the human being. 
While this is simply one scenario of thousands, it is clear that self-driving cars lack the human instinct and decision making that no form of algorithm can replicate. With several unknowns and the high risks associated self-driving cars it is prudent and safest to avoid implementing the idea of self-driving cars as their negative outcomes do not seem to outweigh the benefits that they would have on society.

The con in which I was most interested was the one that stated it could have a negative impact on the economy because it could cause a loss of jobs for those in the driving and transportation industry. I found this fact interesting because I could see how it really could have a spiraling affect - taxi drivers, freight drivers, delivery drivers, limo drivers, bus drivers, etc. ","As with the advent and introduction of any new technology, there are pros and cons that arise with the implementation of that technology. This is also true with autonomous, or self-driving, cars. With the testing of self-driving cars currently happening in several cities across the United States, the debate on whether or not autonomous cars are safer than those driven by humans has come to the forefront of the public health and wellness debate in the media. Many cars already come equipped with some of the basic technology - autonomous breaking, self-parking, or sensors that detect close objects, so we may be closer to the future than we think.

There are several pros for the use of self-driving cars, and one of the biggest is safety. While a small percentage of car accidents could be caused by mechanical failures, the majority are caused by a distracted driver. A computer driver would take the human element factor out of the equation and remove most of the danger just by being a computer. Computers make for the ideal driver as they will not get tired, lose their eyesight, get distracted, imbibe in drugs or alcohol, etc. Computers also use specific algorithms to calculate speed, stopping distance, and other collected information that help to dramatically decrease the chance of an accident. 

In addition to safety, there are many other positive side-effects to autonomous driving. Self-driving cars could help with traffic optimization, as the cars could communicate with each other to help identify traffic problems and their specific algorithms and sensors could help to reduce commute times while also allowing more cars on the road with less traffic. People with disabilities would have more options at their disposal. Police could focus less time on traffic stops and more time on other crimes. People would have more time to do other thigns with less parking and DMV headaches for drivers. The benefits are endless. 

With all the good things that come with technology, there are bound to be some bad things, as well. One of the biggest downfalls anticipated with self-driving cars would be their affect on the economy. Not only is the cost of implementing the new technology more expensive than most Americans can afford, it could also eliminate a lot of jobs in transportation. It is also expected that since most self-driving cars are powered by computers, that they would be electric cars, further putting a strain on the gas industry. Reliance on technology could make a driver's license, insurance, the DMV, and other driving related vendors obsolete. The benefits of self-driving cars would also depend upon more people opting into the option. 

Other downfalls to autonomous cars would be the flaws with technology itself. A computer cannot detect a road block or read human hand signals, so road construction would be an obstacle. The sensors are located on the outside of the vehicle, so severe weather can damage them. Computers attract hackers and software requires user information, so there is always a chance for breach of security. Another risk would be the technology failure where a person must take over the controls - what if it is someone that has never driven their own car before? What if the GPS goes down? How will a person be able to get to where they need to go?

While a completely autonomous driving society is probably a ways off, society certainly seems to be moving towards it. I do believe that self-driving cars would be a benefit in many ways - safety, inclusion, environment, and time/traffic - but I think we have some questions that need to be answered before we get there. While there may be jobs that are lost in transportation, there will be jobs that are created with the technology and manufacturing of these vehicles. The inclusion of people with disabilities, the elderly, and those that do not have a license is a powerful tool for those that were previously reliant on others. In my opinion, self-driving cars will get over the hump and be a part of the near future, at least in a small realm. ",

designated driver needed when the car drives itself

Con: A self-driving car doesn't completely eliminate the likelihood of a car
accident. In fact, there's no legal precedent for how a case would be
handled. The difficult question of who holds responsibility in a car
accident- the driver? The car manufacturer? The software developer?
Could be tricky to answer","This article was interesting and mentioned points that I hadn't thought of before.  I do think that the self driving cars would help decrease the number of accidents that are caused by human error.  There are many heart breaking stories of death or serious injury resulting from persons under the influence getting behind the wheel.  One would think that the number of incidents would decrease with the popularity and affordability of Uber and Lyft.  It is much easier to get from point A to point B when you can simply order a driver on these apps.  Many people still choose to take the risk and drive themselves.  With self driving cars, we would not have to rely on intoxicated people to make the responsible decision to get a designated driver.  

The con I chose seems to be the most complicated logistically.  Who is blamed when something goes wrong?  If a child runs out in front of a car and the car cannot detect it quickly enough and does not stop, who is to blame?  I believe that many people would argue the side of what would happen if it was a human in control of the vehicle?  Would they have been able see the child out of their periphery and anticipate the child might run towards the road?  Perhaps the accident could have been prevented.  To add to this predicament, there will be people attempting to blame to manufacturer for visibility issues.  Other may argue that the driver should have been paying attention still.  What would the rules for that be?  Should the driver still be 100% focused on the road? If that is the case, then that would be conflicting with the pro that people under the influence could still use their cars.

From reading this article, I would have to say that, while self driving cars come with benefits,  I do not think we should work on replacing humans drivers with them solely.  I think that if the purpose is to make driving safer and minimize accidents, then drivers should also be 100% attentive to the road.  I think that driving and traffic conditions are too complicated to leave to just a robot.  There  are many last minute decisions that humans make that can actually save lives.  A self driving car would provide too much comfort to drivers and perhaps lead to them being less cautious.  A false sense of safety behind the wheel is very dangerous.  I think that even with self driving cars, drivers should be held responsible for any accidents (unless there is a true manufacturing error that causes the accident) because I believe that the responsibility still falls on the human to operate the vehicle safely.",

Con: If some of the other traffic technology were to fail (such as traffic lights during a power outage), there would be no protocol for what the cars would and should do.","There has been much discussion on the topic of self driving cars recently. Many people think that having self driving cars on the road would be a bad idea. They worry about things like liability in the case of accidents, and loss of jobs for truck drivers and others employed in the automotive industry. However, self driving cars are the way of the future. The pros of having self driving cars on the road vastly outweigh the cons. The effects of self driving cars will benefit society in a multitude of ways, and will allow mankind to advance further in technology and science alike.

There are many ways that the advent of self driving cars will be beneficial to mankind. For example, many people get distracted while driving, which is one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents in the United States as of now. However, if a computer were to take control of the car, there would no distraction; the computer would stay completely focused on the road, effectively cutting the amount of accidents greatly. This has more implications than just saving human life, there would also be much more money saved as a result of this. Right now there is 9.2 million dollars saved for accidents on the road, less accidents would mean less of this money would have to be saved and could be used in other areas such as infrastructure. Additionally, many cars even have features that resemble early stages of self driving cars; most cars have sensors to detect objects, have autonomous breaking, and many other driver-less car like features. Making the step to fully autonomous cars is not actually as big as a jump as critics may believe. There are many benefits that self driving cars may have for society, and this op-ed only covers a fraction of how self driving cars have the potential to help humanity.

Even with all of the benefits that self driving cars have to offer, there are still some things that critics are worried about. For example, many people worry that people may not have the skills needed to operate cars, and if there was a glitch, this may turn into a serious issue. However, there could easily be regulations enacted that would require drivers to take a test every year or so, to ensure that they can take over in the case of an emergency. Another common concern is handing over the power of the car to a computer, which can malfunction with a small coding error. This is not a valid concern though, as each car would be thoroughly tested before consumer use, and furthermore, humans have even more capacity to 'malfunction' and cause an accident that computers do! Though people may have concerns about the effects of self driving cars on society, they will ultimately accomplish more good than they will harm.

Self driving cars is the subject of much scrutiny. There are many people with strong opinions for both sides. However, after reading this op-ed, I hope that I have convinced you of all of the benefits that self driving cars can bring, and I hope that you are now a supporter of the idea.",

This is interesting because it shows the potential of a self-driving car. 

Con: Simply because there are self-driving cars in the future, humans still have to learn how it works and how to take over if necessary. This is interesting to me because it is probably not what most people think about when a self-driving car is discussed. People probably think more about sleeping or being on their phone while in a self-driving car. ","Self-driving cars seem to be a thing of the future, but as reports of self-driving cars on the streets keep coming up in the media, their dawn on society is evident. There are several proponents against the use of self-driving cars, citing issues of increases in fatality, increases in cost, and legal claims. Nevertheless, manufactures continue to push for testing of this technology and the positives of self-driving cars far seem to outweigh the negatives.  
	The first reason several groups lobby against the implementation of self-driving cars is because of their fear of increased chance for an accident. The argument typical goes that if no one is controlling the wheel of a car, it is likely that the computer will make a mistake and possibly get into an accident or even kill someone. Despite this perspective offering a frightening future, citing cases where individuals have been killed by a self-driving car, it is quick to assume the worst. The fact is that 81 percent of car crashes are caused by human error and the implementation of a self-driving car would eliminate this percentage completely. For any crashes that are caused by a self-driving car, it is likely to be significantly less than that of human error. 
	The second most common reason cited against self-driving cars is the cost of implementing the technology necessary for a self-driving car. Admittedly, the cost associated with the computer software, sensors, and other research and design will surely add to the cost of the car. But what is often overlooked is the significant reduction in insurance costs that will take place. The U.S. Department of Transportation values a human life at $9.2 million, with insurance companies using similar estimates when it comes to fatal car crashes. The burden of a possible crash would be taken off the hands of a human if one were to occur from a self-driving car, however unlikely, therefore reducing costs of insurance and healthcare costs. Another way costs are saved is through the time that will instantly become available to an individual’s when in a self-driving car. Time is money, and if a self-driving car can offer an individual time in their day where they don’t have to worry about stopping at a red light or merging lanes, that is an immediate way to save money. 
	One final reason used to challenge self-driving cars is the fact in legal precedent exists to settle a case where a self-driving car does cause an accident. In the case this does happen, questions of who is responsible and who must pay for damages will surely arise. This is an issue that our society is bound to see arise constantly as we continue to push the current boundaries of technology. To say that society should stifle its growth in the fears of setting legal precedence on a new issue is to prevent the discovery of solutions to current and future issues. If the self-driving car is a solution toward a safer, more productive and cost-efficient future, it is our duty as a society to make sure this technology succeeds.

     Self-driving cars will eliminate many accidents and the gasoline industry which causes too much pollution and whose time has run out. Electric cars are more efficient and generate less pollution. The computer running the car won’t be distracted like humans. Distracted driving is a common cause of traffic accidents. Often people like to talk on their cell phones while driving which is highly dangerous. The average attention span is only eight seconds so a person might not respond fast enough to a deer in the headlights or a bicyclist going past. Human error causes 94% of traffic accidents. Most traffic accidents are caused by drunk and distracted driving.

     A self-driving car will prevent many accidents especially ones caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving is a common cause of traffic accidents. Often people like to talk or text on their cell phones, eat and drink, talk to people in their vehicle, or play with the radio/CD player while driving which is highly dangerous. Children, pets, conversations, and preoccupations such as applying makeup can distract a driver.
    Other causes of accidents such as speeding, drunk or reckless driving, running red lights, running stop signs, unsafe lane changes, wrong-way driving, road rage, and drowsy driving will be eliminated. 
     A self-driving car will probably be electric and electric cars will be better for the environment. Electric cars are more efficient and generate less pollution. An electric car is very quiet and very smooth compared to gas operated cars which are clunky and outdated. Electric cars are cheaper to operate so have a big cost advantage over gas. Electric cars are also more efficient so cost about one-third to one-quarter the cost of gasoline. Maintenance costs are less since electric cars don’t need oil changes. Since electric cars don’t have a tailpipe they will improve the air quality.
     Gas cars pollute the atmosphere so it’s time we eliminate or lessen the gasoline industry so we can breathe healthier air. High levels of chemicals taken in from gasoline exposure like benzene may cause cancer. The inhalation of fumes can lead to confusion, dizziness, headaches and breathing difficulties. Using gasoline is bad since it relies on fossil fuels which are in short supply and dwindling. Therefore it’s time we switched to electric cars.
     The mechanics in gas garages can be trained to work on electric cars instead or for other jobs. When we switched from the horse and buggy to cars we didn’t worry about the people who raised horses losing jobs. We can’t let that stop inevitable progress. People who don’t own cars will still ride the buses and take taxis so those operating the vehicles will still have jobs.",

This point is interesting because rush hour traffic is such a prevalent issue throughout countless states and cities. I think this take on the argument would convince others to buy self driving cars. One con that I find interesting is number 8 which states that self driving cars would struggle in inclement weather. I find this point interesting because I was somewhat surprised that the developers did not originally create self driving cars to handle any type of weather. ,"Self driving cars are a highly debated topic simply because they pose virtually equal amounts of advantages and disadvantages. They offer more efficient transportation, mobility for all people, theoretically safer roads, and overall convenience by improving quality of life. In contrast, they also threaten jobs for those who work in transportation, pose danger in the event of a malfunction, are unable to understand human intention, and rely on somewhat faulty GPS systems. With such important advantages and disadvantages one has to ask if the risk is worth it. Society does not really need self driving cars, but given the direction of technological advances of late, self driving cars seem like a logical next step. The whole point of the digital age essentially is to improve life for everyone and self driving cars have enough potential to do that. Self driving cars are beneficial to society because their potential benefits outweigh the solvable costs they pose. 

The benefits of self driving cars are so wonderful that they diminish the argument to be made against self driving cars. It's no secret that humans are consumed by technology and appear to not get enough of it. The evidence lies in the fact that we can not seem to stay focused on the road for the duration of a car ride without checking our phones for insignificant messages and calls. These seemingly innocent phone checks while driving end up claiming the lives of thousands per year despite laws against texting or calling while on the road. Take Maryland for example, a state with some of the strictest laws against using a cell phone while driving yet it still ranks as one of the highest states for the worst drivers and most fatal accidents. People will continue to break the law as they please, but a computer will not. The computer in a self driving car can not be distracted as shown in pro number 3. For those that argue that yes a computer can not get distracted but they can malfunction I offer this rebuttal: Cars malfunction all the time even without a computer in them. I've read and heard numerous news stories about people driving and all of a sudden their breaks do not work causing them to crash into other drivers. In addition, malfunctions can be easily prevented if not at least securely managed if car companies are forced to offer routine check ups and software updates for the self driving cars. Essentially all of the cons about self driving cars are solvable and preventable problems that fail to overcast a permanent reluctance for their existence. Take for example the argument that self driving cars can not interpret human traffic signals. Embed a software that allows the cars to recognize when a light is out and a human is directing traffic. The car can analyze the human or ask the human in the car what it should do. Of course this is no easy feat but there are enough intelligent people in the world to figure this issue out and others just like it. From being better for the environment to reducing traffic and increasing mobility for the elderly and disabled, self driving cars have countless benefits that society seems to be passing up on.

Self driving cars present more benefits than costs, therefore, they should be implemented in the technology of tomorrow. If more information is shared about self driving cars and how their potential costs can be managed and prevented more people will be willing to make the switch and live a safer, easier life. The decision is simple, the technology exists, the only real debate here is whether society is ready to finally start living in the ""future"". ",

Despite the argument that self-driving cars are safer than human driven cars, this may not be true in unpredictable situations where prior human knowledge is required.
Self-driving cars are able to communicate with each other, which helps to reduce traffic and hazardous situations on the road. This strategy to avoid accidents and make roads more efficient has not been used before and could lead to a significant improvement in road safety.
","In our rapidly developing society, new technology has an impact on so many new industries, especially in transportation. Currently, many cars have features such as motion sensors and autonomous braking. As these features become more prevalent, there is a question of whether self-driving cars will eventually take over the roads. Self-driving cars are determined to be safer than human driven cars due to the removal of human error. They are also proven to be more efficient because the computer has the driving responsibility, and more accessible to those who are not able to drive cars themselves. Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to self-driving cars. Computers are unable to respond to human signals and unpredictable situations, which may be a serious safety concern. The use of self-driving cars may also have a negative effect on the economy because it eliminates many jobs such as taxi drivers, personal injury lawyers, and drivers ed instructors. However, the advantages in safety, efficiency, and accessibility of self-driving cars outweigh these possible risks and demonstrate that self-driving cars would be a very beneficial addition to our society.

Safety is the most notable advantage of self-driving cars. Research shows that 81 percent of car crashes are due to human error. Many factors can lead to unsafe driving for humans, such as distractions, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and speeding. Since computers are not affected by these factors and instead use precise algorithms to drive, this greatly reduces the risk of accidents. Self-driving cars, however, have some disadvantages that human driven cars do not, such as risk of malfunction in certain weather conditions and inability to follow human traffic signals. There is also a question of what the driver may have to do if the technology malfunctions. However, these are all situations that occur infrequently. The situations in which self-driving cars would save lives occur much more frequently, showing that the safety advantages outweigh the possible risks.

Self-driving cars also have many advantages when it comes to efficiency in cost and time. With fewer accidents on the road, money will be saved for insurance and healthcare. Drivers are also able to use time on the road to complete other tasks since they don’t have to focus on the road. In large groups, self-driving cars participate in platooning. The cars are able to communicate with each other, which helps to reduce traffic and hazardous situations on the road. This saves time, gasoline, and also allows cars to travel at higher speeds, further saving driving time. Overall, the efficiency of self-driving cars reduces traffic and makes the road safer.
	
Finally, the accessibility of self-driving cars gives access to transportation to those who cannot drive cars themselves, such as disabled and elderly individuals. Disabled individuals often rely on others for transportation or have to use public transportation, greatly inhibiting their mobility. Access to self-driving cars would allow these individuals to travel in a more convenient way, granting them more freedom. This is true for elderly individuals as well. People often worry about allowing their elderly parents drive at a certain age, concerned about their safety but not wanting to take away their independence. With self-driving cars, this would not be an issue.
	
Though the technology for self-driving cars is not completed yet, these cars demonstrate how technology increases safety, efficiency, and accessibility. If their development is successful, the use of these cars will have a positive impact on the transportation industry and society in general.

The differently-able people can now explore life with speed, thank to the self-driving cars.  From problems such as driving, find parking, tackle traffic and plan the next exit. These autonomous driving cars can even talk to each other and manage a faster trip in extreme traffic scenarios. 

Mostly such people rely on public transportation,or others to get around. This comes forth with a sense of self-pity and helplessness. If they wish to pursue any interests, the commute dampens their motivation. The auto-cars promise to provide enhanced mobility along with self-sufficiency.

 The negative side:
The laser-sensors mounted on the self-driving cars do not function properly in rain. This might pose serious safety threat to the car as well people. Autonomous cars are a developing technology with a lot of scope of improvement. There are lot of loop-holes in the system. Such technology should be adopted only after it 100% secure.","Self-driving cars are a adaption of auto-pilot mode for air planes. It is a promising invention for people in big cities, where pollution and  traffic are going and space is decreasing. Imagine, just sit in the air conditioned car, sleep for half an hour and reach your destination. This too without any worries of parking and the traffic. 
         Like every coin has two sides, this new technology comes up with its set of pros and cons. On one hand, we might just not worry about the rain during our travel, on the other hand, the car's sensors might stop working and car might lose its control.
         On one hand, the there might be no insurance cover required for cars because the computer is making all the decisions. On the other hand, in case of any accident, there would be no one to blame.
         This technology can be used to provide faster health care, better traffic management and closer car parking to users. 
       There is a debate that its a new technology, still in its development phase. There is no scope of error here, as it will directly deal with loss of human life and monetary resources. These cars do not have a controlled environment. There can be a drunk driver on the road, or someone missed the stop sign. A kid might crawl down the road or a new driver may miss the signal. The weather is a natural factor, which we can not control.

    After evaluating all the pros and cons with equal weight, i think the self-driving  cars are the need of the future. The most strong evident is that this technology is already implemented in air planes and Automatic People Movers on the airport.
 
 All the smart and big IT giants fully support this new technology. This technology can bring up a life-changing experience for differently-able people. They no longer need to compute on public transportation. They can be self-reliant to go to university and jobs. This will help their families too.
  These cars don't require technical knowledge to be operated. A kid as well as a old person both can easily travel without company.
     All the big cities like New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong,Mumbai where people spend a lot in the traffic can definitely utilize this new technology to manage the time and pollution on the roads.
    All these factors are strong enough to accept this way to driving. If still there is any doubt, we can consider the following factors: a drunk driver, a pregnant women in urgent need to reach the hospital, a mother with two crying kids in the back seat, an old person not able to bear the glare of head lights. If all such people are driven to their destination, we can imagine how thankful they would be to the self-driving cars.",

Those who are disabled or, quite frankly, too old to drive would be able to benefit from these cars. Also, this would be great for drunk individuals who are momentarily not fit to drive. On the other hand, just because this eliminates the need for the person to be physically capable to drive, there is still a need for the person to educate themselves on how to operate the vehicle safely; this is mental capacity is important in the case of malfunctions.","Society is constantly growing and adapting in regards to its' technology. Products becoming available to the public nowadays would have been completely unfathomable years prior. One futuristic concept being tested now is the idea of self-driving cars.This technology is appealing to society for numerous reasons: accessibility, perceived reduction in accidents, predicted traffic efficiency, etc. On the contrary, there are also many cons to implicating self-driving cars within society: cost, program malfunctions, future driving incompetence, and the future lack of necessity for many jobs involved in physical driving. Despite the good that can come out of self-driving cars, ultimately, the cons of self-driving cars outweighs the benefits it could potentially have for society.
According to the article, one of the leading drives of the desire for self-driving cars is that it will greatly reduce accidents on the roads; however, there are so many factors that need to be perfect for this to be the case. The passenger still needs knowledge of how to operate the mechanics of the car in order to avoid accidents, and with human error being a possibility, there is already a flaw in being accident free. Also, in bad weather situations this can complicate the cars laser sensor on the top; therefore, this means the passenger must be ready in case this malfunctions, and this means accidents driven by human error can occur. Cars can also not be fully programmed with every single possible local driving law, possible road hazard, and construction rerouting. In fact, GPS programs are not always accurate nowadays, but manual driving can correct for this; if a car doesn't have this information it can lead to accidents.There is absolutely no way to ensure that self-driving cars can drastically change accidents.The cars would also complicate legal trials for when accidents do, and inevitably will occur. Who is at fault? The car? The manufacturer? The passenger?
Self-driving cars also cause more harm than good in regards to society and the public. For one, most of the general public will not be able to even afford this. As of now, the costs for engineering, power, and everything else are estimated to at least $100,000. To even reap the slight benefits of the self driving car, it must be implemented in a large quantity of society, and this does not seem practical. Also, even if they are implemented this means that a lot of otherwise important occupations will no longer be needed. Auto manufacturers, drivers ed companies, personal injury lawyers, and the gasoline industries would struggle with finding work. Many people could get laid off due to the lack of need for them, and thus a negative impact on the unemployment rate and economy would be seen.
Technology is a great advantage in modern day society, but only when applied where it is really needed. Would you want to live in a world who eventually has lost the ability to operate a car? A society so reliant on technology that in the result of a glitch or recall could be left with no way to get around due to their reliance on a self-driven car? An innovation that led to the destruction of many jobs for working Americans? Why deal with all of these dilemmas when the task of manually driving a car would eliminate so many economic, moral, and safety dilemmas?",

I find this interesting because car accidents are highly prevalent in our society, whether they be from driving while under the influence, or while being distracted by something such as a cell phone. A 'con' that stuck out to me was definitely the one in which there would be considerable job loss in the public transportation sector. Although see driving cars are safer alternatives,  these people will be put out of their jobs because of this technology. ","Technology is evolving everyday and is a huge part in our lives as humans living in the 21st century. It is almost like living in a Sci-Fi movie. From our phones,tvs and even to our refrigerators, everything seems to be 'smart', and pretty soon, we might even be ale to put our cars on that list. A world with self driving cars might not be too far off for us, as Google has been testing cars that indeed drive themselves in certain states. But, are these cars really more beneficial for us as a society? Some may argue that, yes, self driving cars would be more beneficial because they are safer than human drivers, which would reduce car accidents tremendously. I hold with the opinion that these cars would not be more beneficial, because they are more costly, not only in money, but could be costly with lives as well. 

It has been shown that upwards of 33,000 people die annually from car accidents, and many people believe that these self driving cars can be the resolution. Car accidents are often caused by human error, like distractions. Many people in support may argue that these self driving cars are ran by computers, thus unable to become distracted, significantly lowering the probability of fatal car accidents. These cars are ran by complex algorithms that allow the car to be aware of its surroundings, as well as have a faster response time which would be beneficial for stopping. With the value of a human life being around 9.2 million, it is proposed that these cars wold save millions of dollars with the reduction of accidents. 

All of this sounds like an amazing, but self driving cars would actually do more harm than good. First, these cars would be more costly in any ways. Car accidents caused by human error may decrease, but accidents based on computer error are still very likely, thus still causing a high cost in human life. As far as monetary costs go, in the case of an accident caused by these self driving cars, who would be to blame?  Some may argue the manufacturer, others the software developer, but fatal deaths caused by these cars can cause a long, expensive, and tiring legal battle for the people involved. These cars would cause many people in the transportation circuit to be put out of their jobs. Taxi drivers, cab drivers, delivery people, and many many more will be unemployed because of these technologies, thus greatly affecting their livelihoods. These cars may even endanger the insurance job markets because the need for car insurance will be no more. 

With all of the reliance on technology, self driving cars may sound great at first glance. But, these things that might improve one aspect of human life, will severely diminish the livelihoods of others. Self driving cars can be dangerous, and will damage the job market. Say no to self driving cars.

Among the cons, I thought #17, which states that gasoline industry would face a difficulty because of the use of electricity for self-driving cars, was a weak (interesting?) argument since it is likely that they will suffer anyways as new cars, regardless of the self-driving technology, use electricity for their fuel.","Technological advances have made our society more convenient and efficient in a variety of areas, including social networking services, shopping experiences, and personalized online streaming services, although there has always been controversy on whether the technology is making our society better or worse. As we have imagined since decades ago, technologies are now being tested for cars for the purpose of creating safer self-driving cars with the use of sophisticated algorithms. However, as relying on the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use. While I admit that the risk can be high, I believe that the self-driving technology can create more opportunities for people having a variety of difficulties and help detect ""errors"" easily which can improve the technology continuously.

First, self-driving cars can be useful not only for ordinal people like us but also disabled people, pregnant women, and other people having a difficulty driving a car. These people, because they cannot drive a car, need to use public transportations or assistance when they go shopping, travel, and commute, which can be particularly hard where public transportation is not developed and/or in busy cities and downtowns where other people are usually in hurry.
Self-driving cars can provide a new, better, and personalized way for those people who cannot drive and have trouble using public transportations. Although there are several risks associated with self-driving cars, including the inability of operating safely in a variety of weather conditions and traffic situations, we cannot predict that these risks are higher than risks associated with human drivers, such as distraction, drinking, and sleeping during driving. As there is always a risk when driving a car, regardless of the use of the self-driving technology or not, it would be reasonable to introduce self-driving cars and create a better transportation opportunity for people having a hard time driving and using other means of transportation.

Furthermore, the risks mentioned above can be minimized as we collect data. One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact, fine-grained cause when an accident occurs due to a human error. Even when we detect factors that caused the accident, the immediate improvement would not happen. Although educational programs and policy changes have been implemented to prevent car accidents, such changes require time to show the effect. 

In conclusion, I believe that introducing self-driving cars can provide new opportunities for those having difficulty driving and using other transportations and risks associated with the self-driving technologies can be minimized as we collect data, which can decrease the number of car accidents and therefore offer a better experience for people.

Con: Computers are not immune to malfunctioning; computer algorithms are not infallible. The great danger of self-driven cars is that a computer that malfunctions or a program that has been hacked into or infected with a virus my cause accidents that may not be prevented in time unless the rider happens to have the requisite technical skill.","I marvel at the ingenuity of our scientists and engineers in bringing us so close to the possibility of self-driven vehicles. 

Furthermore, I am a free spirit who cherishes her independence, including the freedom to go where she pleases when she pleases, without having to rely on other people, their schedules, their preferences and especially their notions about what I, as a woman of a certain age, should or should not be doing. All this makes me deeply empathetic toward seniors and the disabled who may not be able to drive, and for their sakes, I can deeply appreciate the value of a self-driven vehicle.

Moreover, since self-driven cars are likely to be electric, they could mean the end of our reliance on fossil fuels,  something deeply to be desired by all of us who are worried about the future of our polluted planet.

And yet, I find that something deeper, perhaps even less rational, but nonetheless ineluctable, keeps me from endorsing self-driven, at least for the present.

We seem happy to cede increasing portions of our lives to computers. In cases where computers are absolutely better than us at certain things, e.g. the analysis of large quantities of crucial health-related data, there can be no quarrel with their exclusive use. But 
I fear we may be in danger of losing too many of our everyday skills to them, in areas where they are not particularly better than we are. Driving is a case in point. You may ask what is so valuable about this skill. And I grant that for many, driving is routine, perhaps even tedious. Even so, there is a whole parcel of skills that are ancillary to driving per se. I mean the ability to be attentive and alert in a dynamic situation, the ability to be with others and jointly negotiate traffic so that all who use the streets, including cyclists and pedestrians, are safe and minimally inconvenienced. In our increasingly atomized world, these are not skills and capacities we can afford to lose. More is at stake than we might imagine. 

And then, there is the questions of safety. We all know that computer algorithms are not infallible, that programs can be infected with viruses, that hardware can malfunction, that computers are at the mercy of hackers. A human driver has a repertoire of skills to call upon in the event of unforeseen situations: an accident, bad weather, a terrorist attack. As far as I am aware, computer algorithms that function in very dynamic situations without human intervention are not that plentiful. What then would a rider do, especially if they are not tech savvy, in a complex and fluid situation?  You may argue that we are everyday and everywhere rendered helpless by such things as drunk or inattentive motorists, with dire consequences that are clear from the statistics about accidents. I cannot disagree. And yet, I find I must stand my ground. I ask you to imagine a situation where your self-driving car cannot adapt in time, nor can the cars of anyone else, and you're all,  every single one of you, headed for disaster with no recourse, where at least if you were at the wheel you could have attempted some solution. It is this removal of human agency that I worry about. This helplessness that is not natural human vulnerability but thralldom to machines. Unlike human vulnerability, which 
can be the source of virtues like compassion and pity, this thralldom is not generative, it is lifeless in the way of an inorganic thing. I do not wish to be thus reduced.

A major positive is that it has a huge potential to reduce the number of auto accidents occurring today. Due to the calculative and meticulous nature of computers, we can rely on their software to calculate the best courses of actions while driving. Computers can't get tired, can't get distracted, and cannot make self-destructive choices that humans can.

On the other hand, a major con is the unique vulnerability of computers, which are very easy to hack or confuse if not programmed well enough, whereas humans have intuition which is hard to emulate in software.","Today's society is seeing the start of a new era in technology, where artificial intelligence is becoming mainstream, and so is our reliance on them. This includes the gradual integration of self-driving cars, or cars that rely on computer programming to give it directions.

This can be a great improvement to driving safety, as this is potentially a much secure form of driving. Humans are easily fallible -- they can get distracted, feel sleepy, become under the influence -- and drastically increase their chance of accidents. Computers, however, do not succumb to such mistakes.

Additionally, they are able to communicate with other computers easily, so if there were multiple self-driving cars on the road, they can all sense each other within seconds and know how to navigate from there.

However, computers are not 100% fool-proof. They are hackable. They can be fooled. And they rely on more people to ""opt-in"" and drive their own self-driving car, otherwise, accidents will still happen.

But the thing is, dear reader, that all these cons can be remedied with time. We are currently seeing the beginning of this new stage in automation, but the idea of relying on new technology to propel us forward in society is a long-standing tradition. This is a natural process.

The more we work on this technology, the safer it will become. We will develop new software updates to prevent its hackability. We will improve upon its spatial awareness and its adaptability in order for the programs to be fooled as easily, or at all. And the more we improve upon it, the more widespread the technology will be, which will cause its pricepoint to decrease and in turn make self-driving cars much more accessible. 

There is also the concern about the start of a dystopian-like society. ""What if we become too reliant on our technology and then it decides to stop working, or it turns against us?"" To that, dear reader, I say: science-fiction is still science-fiction. Just because we learned how to use a calculator does not mean we have stopped learning mathematics in school. Just because we have the autopilot in planes does not mean we do not stop teaching pilots how to fly. And just because we can use self-driving cars does not mean we will stop learning how to drive.

But, dear reader, I will definitely tell you this: stick shift deserves to become forgotten and buried forever.",

As a result, the 81% of crashes due to human error would be prevented. This argument is interesting because it assumes that all human error crashes are due solely to bad behavior and furthermore presumes that human error would not be replaced at least in part by computer error such as software bugs. However, there exist various instances where one or both of these presumptions fail. 

Con #4: The computers of self-driving cars would be a target for hackers, according to the Guardian. There are so many situations where a self-driving car could be led to cause accidents. One such scenario: a hacker can encourage the cars to engage in a platooning pattern (where the cars line up closely behind each other like train cars), at which point the cars would be like a line of little ducklings ready to do the bidding of Mother Duck, leading them off the road or suddenly slamming on the brakes when the cars are very close and travelling at high speeds. ","Society remains divided on the issue of self-driving cars. Some people think they’re great: they should reduce accidents, free up drivers’ time, and make obsolete the need for detailed knowledge of driving, thus letting students learn other subjects in school and allowing people who could never use cars alone in the past (like the disabled and elderly) more freedom. Meanwhile, others focus on the problems. Computers would not make decisions and adapt in the same manner as attentive human drivers, provide more security risks, and present a large potential for vehicle failure. I side with this latter group, and my main reasoning is that there are more weaknesses and things that can go wrong with a computer than with a human.
I’ve got a little story on computers who’ve been trained to act like they can drive better than humans can. In April my parents and I were in Florida visiting my grandparents. We had a rental car and my father was driving on the highway. A car in front of us was going far below the speed limit, so my father punched the accelerator in order to pass it. The rental car’s computer determined that he must have meant to hit the brakes and hit the accelerator by mistake. So, the car suddenly locked up on the busy highway and stopped, causing all passengers to be thrown forward and the car behind us to nearly rear-end us. There was no human error involved here. No distracted driving. Just a system that has been trusted and deployed into millions of cars on the road, activating without the driver’s knowledge or consent. This “feature” is just a taste of what interacting with full-blown self-driving cars would be like.
Autonomous vehicles pose even more risks when we move beyond considering bad software that only influences how the car interacts with the driver and begin to think about security and how the computer handles driving in varying environmental conditions and around other drivers. According to the Guardian, the self-driving cars’ computers would be a target for hackers. There are so many situations where a self-driving car could be led to cause accidents, especially if the human behind the wheel has never learned to drive or is too distracted or too trusting in the vehicle’s technology to intervene. A simple idea is that a hacker can encourage the cars to engage in a platooning pattern (where the cars line up closely behind each other like train cars), at which point the cars would be like a line of little ducklings ready to do the bidding of Mother Duck, leading them off the road or suddenly slamming on the brakes when the cars are very close and travelling at high speeds. 
Many proponents of self-driving cars act on the presumption that vehicle computers have an understanding of the environment around them, and in fact would be even more aware than a distracted human would be. Sure, if they’re equipped with the right sensors they’ll know the speeds of nearby cars, they’ll acknowledge the possibility that a child or deer could run onto the road at any moment, and they’ll probably monitor weather conditions. But in terms of anticipating the behavior of other drivers, they fall short. When I drive, I can look at other vehicles and anticipate their behavior. This driver is turned around looking at their kid in the backseat. This person’s truck has tree branches in the back that aren’t tied down. This person’s car has been rear-ended several times and the bumper is being held on with duct tape. Each of these pieces of information influences what I expect the driver to act like. A computer isn’t going to look at its surroundings and judge everything like this. As such, a computer will not be as well-informed or adaptive as humans, because we will never be able to anticipate all the different types of drivers that the computer would need to be ready to judge. 
Overall, there is no debate that a self-driving car would behave differently from a human-driven one. Much of this discrepancy is due to the fact that computers are endowed with the ability to be truly conscious and can be easily mislead or misinformed. ",

People who would usually take public transportation, which are limited in the areas that they go to, would have the opportunity to go where ever they would like with a lot more ease. 

A con of self-driving cars is that they may eliminate many jobs in the transportation market. Many people make a living by transporting goods and other people. An example of this includes truck drivers that deliver various products ranging from food to petroleum. Uber, a service that is used daily by many people, may lay off hundreds of thousands of workers. ","The self-driving car is a groundbreaking piece of technology. There is no doubt about that. However, I really question how feasible it is to transition them into every day life in America. The potential advantages of self-driving cars are incredible: safer driving via decreased accidents, the inability for a computer to get distracted, identifying traffic problems and no longer needing a designated driver, saving money, and saving time. On the other hand, the disadvantages of self-driving cars are quite frightening as they are weather dependent, they can't detect human traffic signals, they could malfunction and put the driver at even more risk, they rely on other pieces of technology we haven't yet mastered and jobs in fields connected to transportation would suffer. In other words, there is no solid evidence that self-driving cars are qualitatively safer. 

In my opinion, I don't think it is the time to bring them out and try to adopt them into society. We need time to develop our technology in general to a point where if we were to start using them, they'd have a smooth transition into the market and outside parties would suffer as little as possible. I think they have the potential to be incredibly beneficial to society but not right now. 

If we were to start using them in today's society, it wouldn't work out in many ways. Only a small percentage of the population would be able to afford them as they cost more than $100,000 and require training to operate in a safe manner. Furthermore, self-driving cars rely on being adopted by everybody and this will certainly not happen if only the richest people are able to buy them. Security risks are also a relevant issue as hackers would be very interested in the technology and specialized computers could be able to collect personal data. Even if self-driving cars were cheap enough to be used by the general public, many jobs would be eliminated. Workers in the transportation sector would no longer be needed, the gasoline industry would suffer if self-driving cars are electric, driver's ed courses wouldn't be needed anymore and personal injury lawyers would have reduced earnings due to less accidents on the road. This would be detrimental for the lives of many people and also harm the economy. Because of these reasons, 1) I don' think it is feasible to get the general public to use self-driving cars and 2) in the unlikely case that everyone uses them, it would cause damage to the economy.

With self driving cars, however, there would be no need for anyone drunk to drive home, considering the car itself would be driving the passengers home. This would save many lives that would've been otherwise lost to drunk driving.

Con (9): This issue would occur when other integral parts of the traffic system were to go out of order (aka Traffic Lights). This would leave the car to have to try and interpret human traffic signals, which most cars at this point in time aren't able to do. ","Self Driving Cars is something almost everybody wishes would become reality, but don't know how they would work once they did. Self-driving cars in theory are a wonderful thing; You would save so much time that you would have spent driving, and there wouldn't be any human error that leads to the numerous accidents that we hear about on a yearly basis. However, now that they are in active development, what's the consensus? What do people think? 

The interesting thing about Self Driving Cars is that their greatest strengths also serve as great weaknesses. If we were to talk about the pros of self driving cars, it would easily be that they remove all risk that a human driver would bring to the table. They would have perfect control of the car, removing all risks of drunk driving or some irregular movement on the part of the driver. If done right, self-driving cars could remove all human error from driving and save many lives that would've been lost to vehicle related incidents. 

That being said, removing the human from the equation isn't all good, especially at this point in the development cycle for self driving cars. Without the human, you no longer have any cognitive judgement regarding driver safety. Cars may determine to use the most efficient road rather than the one safest for the passengers. Cars may also not be able to function in bad weather, as heavy precipitation could result in damage to integral sensors needed for the self driving functionality. The cars may not be able to recognize things human could (human turn signals for example). Removing the human removes all of the risk of a human driver, but also all of the potential problem solving that humans could perform.

I personally am all in favor of self driving cars. Aside from the fact that I don't think I'm a good driver (I'm probably not), I believe that working on the self-driving car problem goes a long way in solving many problems in Computer Science. An example is that a self driving car would need to be able to have a car recognize other cars, measure distance, discern road hazards, etc. This requires a very advance Computer Vision system to be able to work.

In addition to that, most humans are either lazy, or they want to work as much as possible. Self driving cars allows for a lot of effort AND lots of time to be saved. This would make human lives easier. I support self driving cars, and think they are leading the way towards a better future.",

Having the ability to self-operate a car is not realistic for all people, and often people depend on other modalities or people to get from place to place. For those that this pertains to, having the independence and increased mobility that self-driving cars allow could change their quality of life. I found this pro interesting because the main focus around self-driving cars seems to be the ability to rid driver distraction. However, clearly, it can still help people that have never had to worry about getting distracted while being in the driver's seat. At the same time, though, I do not feel as though this is the strongest point because there is definitely a large population of disabled individuals that would not be able to operate the self-driving cars and would still rely on other people. 

Con: If other technology fails, such as traffic signals that the cars rely on, there's no accounting for human traffic signals. In the event of an accident, for example, where a police officer is directly traffic, the cars cannot interpret human signals. 

Self-driving cars would not be proficient in situations that veer from the typical technology used on the roads. If a police officer was in the middle of the road because a traffic signal was not working, the self-driving car would not be able to understand the hand motions that the police officer was making. I chose this con because I believe it is an extremely strong, and often overlooked, point. It is common for traffic officials or other individuals to have to control a situation on the road. Not being able to successfully navigate through such a situation can be dangerous for not only the people in the car, but everyone around the car, as well. 
","The day someone learns how to drive is a turning point in their lives and the lives of their family members. The new driver has a freshly established sense of independence and their family members no longer have to carpool them to wherever they need to go. However, with this privilege, comes lots of responsibility and potential danger. For this reason, and several others, self-driving cars are starting to make an appearance. Do these self-driving cars – the “ideal motorists” who do not get distracted the way current drivers do, are programmed to react immediately to cars in close proximity, and have the potential to significantly decrease traffic – truly make roads safer, or is this a fad that will soon be out of style? Due to the education required to operate a self-driving car, the necessary compliance among a majority of Americans to see the positive effects, and the relinquishing the power that human emotion and decision-making has, self-driving cars would serve as more of a problem than a solution. 
	Between logging a certain amount of hours as a student-driver and ultimately passing the driving test, the process to be able to legally drive can be long and grueling. Requiring even more training for individuals to operate a self-driving car may be intriguing for some, but unrealistic for most. At the same time, while the younger generations are becoming more tech-savvy, older adults and elders can struggle with operating technology. How are those who are confused on how to use an iPhone or computer expected to fully comprehend and operate a self-driving car? Likewise, if a person is still responsible for operating a self-driving car, then that defeats the purpose of self-driving cars allowing the passengers to direct their attention elsewhere when in a car. The idea that a majority of America’s drivers would take the time to learn how to work a self-driving car, and be able to do it successfully, nonetheless, is impractical. 
	In a perfect world, if every American with a car owned and effectively drove a self-driving car, the roads would likely be safer, traffic would be decreased, and police officers could spend their time focusing on more pressing issues other than enforcing speed limits. However, with the amount of people that have little interest in self-driving cars, whether it is because of their price, required training, or simply the absence of their significant need, the lack of compliance with this movement will make these potential positive effects highly unlikely to see. In fact, having a mix of both regular cars and self-driving cars sharing the road could be confusing and problematic. 
	While robots and technology can sometimes be proven to be smarter than the human mind, the one thing they lack is human emotion and rational thinking. In driving, both of these play a major role. Whether a person decides they want to change the route to their destination or has to react instantaneously to something on the road, among other situations, drivers are constantly putting a lot of thought into driving. Giving a robotic-run car essentially full control of all of this, especially when it is expected to keep everyone in the car safe, is taking a leap of faith – one that may be too risky to take. Although there is most certainly a need for safer roads and more focused driving, the training, compliance and lack of human input allowed with self-driving cars makes it unlikely that they will be the future of the American roads.",

On the contrary, self-driving cars would eliminate myriad jobs and could discourage the need for driver’s education, which could ultimately, result in more human fatalities. Moreover, it would be imperative that those who utilize self-driving cars experience education in using the self-driving car. While computers are very adept, there is still propensity for error and passengers must be informed on what to do when things go wrong.
","On the night of my roommate’s twenty first birthday, a group of her friends swerved on a windy and slippery road into a tree and were profoundly injured while on the way to meet us to celebrate.

There are many factors that influence our decisions when driving – how much rest we have had the night prior, how many miscellaneous things we have on our minds that cause our attention to falter, and unfortunately, perhaps even the amount of alcohol we have consumed, if we are not making smart decisions. With so many incidents such as this, the pressing issue becomes: how do we make roads safer for all?

With eighty-one percent of car crashes being due to human error, the idea to use computers to operate cars appears to be a salient decision. As the article illuminates, there are “no opportunities for a computer to be ‘distracted’.  But how can we be certain that this is valid? Computers, like humans, have the propensity to make mistakes. Although self-driving cars may be “more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers” a self-driving car does not eliminate the likelihood of a car accident. There are many variables to consider when thinking about individuals using self-driving cars: the weather, other traditional cars and their drivers, and the possibility of inappropriate - or developmentally inappropriate person - like children, mistakenly getting behind the wheel. In these cases of an emergency, passengers of the self-driving car may be overwhelmed or uneducated of how to respond in order to safely redirect the car. 

One point to support the use of self-driven cars, however, is the way in which self-driving cars would support individuals with disabilities who rely on public transportation in order to travel. I believe this would be an accommodation that would make many destinations more accessible for those who could not drive themselves. Moreover, self-driven cars would be beneficial for the environment, as they would be electric and would not require gasoline to operate, which would, in turn would save users money as well. 

Despite the innovative benefits of self-driving cars, I am wary of the notion of automatic cars and would not partake in purchasing one. To me, there is something very calming and enjoyable about driving, and I believe that many people feel the same way. That being said, the responsibility of the individual is to make informed decisions when driving in order to protect themselves and others while on the road.

I am interested because it is a solution to a preventable problem that causes time delays and traffic on the way into Pittsburgh.
One of the cons to self-driving cars that is mentioned in the article is that not many people will be able to afford the cars initially. Therefore, some of the benefits to self-driving cars, like the one I mentioned above, will happen years after the self-driving car is introduced to drivers.","We all recognize the superficial pros and cons to self-driving cars; as well as, already have an opinion on them. However, there are some pros and cons to self-driving cars that may surprise you and even make you reconsider your initial bias. Some of the obvious pros of self-driving cars are that they are safer for the driver and others due to the many sensors and the computer the car uses while driving; a computer will never be distracted; and you could be working on something else during your commute. Some pros are not at first evident such as the fact that physically disabled persons will be able to commute on their own. They will not need to rely on others to drive them, increasing their independence. Commute time due to traffic and time wasted to look for parking will also be cut because self-driving cars will eliminate platooning and can go park itself after dropping you off. 
On the flip side, self-driving cars raise obvious hazards and skepticism. They will be much more expensive than current vehicles which means that many of their benefits will not come to fruition until the majority of people are able to purchase them. Self-driving cars could hurt the economy as many jobs will be eliminated such as Uber and taxi. A large con that many might overlook is that the self-driving car does not respond to human traffic signals. This means that if the traffic lights fail, the self-driving cars will not function properly to police guided traffic or to four-way spot.
It is my opinion that self-driving cars are beneficial to society. After reading about pros and cons of the self-driving car, I think that the self-driving car is an inevitable push of the future. The cons that are listed can be eliminated by research and more advances to the technology in the car. The only setback to the self-driving car after all the problems are solved will be that people will feel their independence of driving is taken away. Since we can eliminate the safety problems of the self-driving car by innovations, I find that only the pros are left. Self-driving cars can make society more efficient by cutting wasted time in traffic, greatly decrease accidents and deaths due to car crashes, and make the commuting experience much more enjoyable. The futuristic dream of cars driving themselves is coming and we should embrace the benefits that it will bring to society in the economic, social, and cultural aspects.",

One con that I found interesting is that it was anticipated that personal injury lawyers would lose money because of the lessening of injuries from less accidents. I found these interesting because, in the case of the pro, there are so many bad drivers on the roads today. It would be amazing to see those drivers canceled out by a computer. The con I found interesting for a more ironic reason. I have no sympathy for personal injury lawyers, in this case specifically. For personal injury lawyers to have a job there has to be an injury. I see their loss, in this instance, as a major gain for people.","It seems that we are moving rapidly forward to a future that will consist of a majority of self-driving cars. Along with all major technological advancements that have occurred in the twenty-first century there are major pros and major cons to this advancement.
 In general, many of the pros center preventing damage. Many crashes are caused by poor drivers and human error. The computer system incorporated into self-driving cars would account for many errors that humans make. This would also include major distractions for human drivers including drunk driving and texting and driving. Self-driving cars also are likely to save lives. These cars would also cut out the middle man costs for a lot of driving in the form of insurance and drivers ed. Lastly, there are many factors that will help to allow people to take full advantage of the time that they have. Without the burden of driving, people can use that time to do other things. Also, increased speed limits and adaptations to road obstructions can get people to their destinations faster.
There are also many potential negatives, many of which seem to effect the lower class. Self driving cars are bound to be expensive, and outside of the reach of many Americans. additionally, many people rely on providing transportation as their means of making money. Also, there is the fallibility of machines. The software involved in the self-driving cars might be hacked, there may be detection issues, and weather may effect the detection. There is also the issue of responsibility in the case of an incident. Who is to blame in the event of an accident?
With both sides of the issue being addressed, I will now give my personal stance on the issue. I am of the belief that self driving cars are better for the world than they are worse. I want to start by acknowledging my privilege. I am on the trajectory to be in a financial situation to be able to afford a car like this. Especially if insurance costs are cut out, I see potentially being able to afford a self driving car. More generally, I believe that cutting out the human errors are extremely important. With more and more cars being on the roads today, there is a higher and higher chance to be in an accident as a result of human error. To eliminate that, I feel, would be a huge win. Secondly, having much more time would be a great thing. Like the saying goes, time is the one thing that you can never get back.To potentially take less time to get places, and to be able to use the time that you would usually be driving would be extremely helpful. Overall, I believe that these benefits greatly outweigh the costs.",

It appeals to me as I appreciate technology which can benefit not only many normal people, but those who need help as well.

For the downsides, I am mainly concerned with the privacy issue of self-driving cars. Nowadays the privacy of people breaches through social networks, phones and various electronic systems. This issue is absolutely concerning as well in self-driving cars system.
","After decades of the prosperous advances of artificial intelligence (AI), especially among the last several years when we have benefited from AI tremendously on a variety of domains such as medicine, e-commerce and digit devices, one futuristic industry also equipped with the power of AI is gradually stepping to people's life: the self-driving cars.

We are happy and lucky to be seeing the history of the way that how people are transported changes. The most recent one that is taking place quietly is brought by self-driving cars, which as the name indicates, can drive itself without the operation of human. Sometimes they are called ""driver-less cars"" too. Indeed, the reality is that self-driving cars aren't that far off. Right now, the residents from Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, California and Pennsylvania are fortunate enough to have already seen some tested self-driving cars are running merrily down the streets, wearing lots of cameras which make them look strange but cute.

Alongside the technology of self-driving cars that has emerged during this time while not yet realized, the debate on the pros vs. cons of self-driving cars has already started to rage on. Whether it is a gift of God, or just another devil coming out from Pandora's Box? People hold different ideas. But are self-driving cars really that controversial? If they are, then why hundreds of huge companies, including Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, Tencent, are now researching dramatically on self-driving cars? Are they crazy? Are they wasting their money on these ""terrible"" products? 

The answers can't be too obvious. Self-driving ARE the most beautiful gifts endowed by our God.

There are uncountable benefits of self-driving cars. Among them there are two prominent ones. The first regards the driving safety. While surely some faulty mechanics can be cited as the cause for certain accidents, more often than not drivers themselves are the most dangerous things about hitting the open road. Google's director of the self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, says the company's vehicles are better all around: ""They are more courteous and more defensive drivers than normal drivers."" Indeed, a computer is actually an ideal motorist, which uses delicately designed algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically. 

The second advantage is that self-driving cars can benefit not only many normal people, but those who desperately need help as well. For example they will give more freedom and enhanced mobility to people who are not suited to driving, such as the handicapped, the drunk or the senior citizens. With self-driving cars, their rely on public transportation or
assistance from others to get around would become minimal.

Well, up till now those people who are pessimistic about self-driving cars may barely argue the their benefits, but they are overly concerning with some potential factors. Here we would list out two of the most controversial issues which, however, are not problems at all, in our opinion. 

Firstly of all, some individuals are concerned about the opportunity for a computer built into the self-driving car to collect personal data. Indeed, we have that risk. However, in the future with the development computers and AI, every device or item in our life will get electronic-wised and the information of every thing's information, a human or physical item, will flow through the internet of things (IOT), in order to make our life more intelligent. Self-driving cars is only a small portion of it the the personal data problem is not specific to it. Further, we believe in the future the protection of private data will be enhanced significantly.

Second, people argue ""self-driving cars would eliminate many jobs in the transportation sector, especially when it comes to freight transportation and taxi drivers."" This could have a negative impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. However, this effect is short-term, for the sake of long term advancement of human history. In other words, if we forbid the development of self-driving cars because of this short-term interest, then people will improve on transportation in a long term.

Therefore, just let us embrace the bright future of self-driving cars and look forward to enjoying the convenience shortly!

One of the main advantages of having self-driving cars in our streets is the decreasing the level of car accidents. It is not a secret that the main cause of car accidents is human-made mistakes. Thus, if we programme our cars to drive according to the rules, we will definitely reduce the rate of car accidents. 
Con: 
Having self-driving cars in our streets might lead to increasing the level of unemployment. This is because of the job titles, like taxi drivers, would disappear if we let the car to drive itself. As for some people being a taxi driver is a source of main income to cover expenses, this happens to be the main concern of getting new technology as self-driving cars","      Seeing driverless cars in the streets of Pittsburgh might lead to a big question which is ""Is it going to work out?"". It is not easy to answer this question. Before making any judgments, it is wise to brainstorm some crucial advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. 
      The main advantage of developing this new technology is to reduce car accidents. There is no shadow of a doubt that the main cause of road accidents is the mistakes made by people, us. I guess this was the motivation behind creating driverless cars, to get rid of the main factor. Reducing the car accidents would help us save millions of lives and millions of dollars. However, some people may argue that self-driving cars are not perfect enough, especially in terms of driving in severe weather conditions. As many people know, some car accidents happen to be during the severe weather conditions.  
       Another advantage of driverless cars is saving some money. Getting a driverless car means that the owner will pay less for the car insurance, or even not to have one, and save money on gasoline, because self-driving cars are run by electricity. On the other hand, the latter helps us retain a sustainable environment. However, there are still some people that might argue instead of saving money, the owners of those fancy cars might end by paying more, for the short-term. Because self-driving cars will cost approximately $100 000 on average. However, in the far future, that number might decrease as the competition rate among car manufacturing companies rises. 
       The last but not least benefit of getting a driverless car is saving time. Time is money, is not it? There will be no need to take driving courses, going through the process of plenty of examinations to get the driver's license and so on. Even for this advantage, we will find a group of people which might argue by saying owners still need to spend some time to comprehend new information, especially in terms of pressing the button on the car. If we compare those two time series, the former will happen to be the most time and energy consuming sets of activities. 
       Overall, it is clear that the advantages of developing self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages. Whenever a new technological development knocks on our door, there will be a group of people who will open the door with the smile on their faces, another group of the people who will hesitate to open but still want to know what that is, and the third crowd who will shut the door before even knocking. So, I would say that it is good to be a part of the first and the second groups of people. ",

It is an intriguing idea that all cars will be formed in the same structure of communication system which resembles to the case that computer IP addresses connect to the Internet and the latter can locate it via the former.  

Con: Linking all cars into one networking system raises a moral issue that all personal data, including home addresses and favorite places, may be at risk. It is of significance to protect privacy and safety for ""drivers"" and passengers. ","The reading provides readers with several straightforward explanations in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. The beneficial side introduces the higher possibility of lower accidents due to limited human errors by applying computer systems in cars, the time efficiency from the drivers' perspective, the convenience for disabled population, and smoother traffic. However, the opposing side points out several serious issues, such as violation of privacy, unemployment, and inefficiency under severe weather. I hold the disagreement toward the pro-side and believe that self-driving cars may pose unavoidable threats to the overall well-being of the society. I construct my arguments from the stances of safety, privacy protection, and employment. 

To start with, it may be the fact that human errors cause more frequent and severer accidents than mechanical malfunctions. But how can we safely assume that once computer systems take fully control of the vehicle, and that could eliminate mechanical errors? In particular, cars may contain mechanical defects by construction, computer system built in the car may barely notice or detect any of the manufacturing issues, let alone of reducing accidents in the driving practice. Furthermore, driver or passenger may still play an important role in the driving process since people have to give commands to the computer system in the car. What if people make mistakes or push the system to perform personal choices? Accidents may still be possible under such contexts. New risks and dangers thus deteriorate the smooth function of the society.  

Second, computer in a car needs to acquire as many information as possible to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the driving decisions. This car automatically collects information from all others, and if criminals make full use of this function, they can escape from detection or police chase by flawlessly escaping by a car built with computer tracking system. In such a case, the privacy of police officers has been violated. But if police can override all the cars systems, will that be fair to citizens? Before self-driving car serves disruptively for the society, several moral issues in terms of privacy protection should be considered and hopefully solved.

Third, professional drivers lose jobs if computer system is the only approved driver for all cars. So do the relevant sectors including car insurance companies, and traffic guiding officers. And how should we deal with this dramatic change when suddenly unemployment impairs the stability of the society? New skills are needed, and new supporting sectors can emerge. But public institutions and government have to get prepared for the transition for its people which can be time-consuming and is possible to lead to unsatisfied outcomes.

In summary, self-driving cars as a type of innovation certainly will promote the industrial change of a society. However, we cannot assume that any innovation dramatically benefits the development of the society. Based on current technology and legal situations, self-driving cars may not be as beneficial as imagined. And we should be cautious for approving such changes in our society. ",

In an attempt to accurately measure the costs of transportation, The Dept of Transportation has computed a value for the cost of a human life. Priced at 9.2 million dollars, this cost could be decreased significantly if the standardization of self-driving cars were to occur. I thought this was interesting because I didn’t know there was an estimated cost of life calculation done by this or any governmental department. I was actually a little surprised the number was so high.

CON #8 Restatement:

Self-driving cars are held back by the limitations imposed upon them by the technology of our time. Their instruments for navigating the roads, while advanced, are not perfect, and have limits to their implementation. These functions of navigation could at times be rendered useless by inclement weather and such— And in doing so they once again leave the driver in command of the car (if this is even an option). This “con” interested me because it seemed hypocritical to call out the limitations of the tech within a car but not mention the limitations of the average person manually driving under extreme circumstances.
","OP-ED:

Over the last decade, technology has quickly found itself a part of nearly every aspect of daily life. It makes each day easier, simpler, and often safer for all of society. Automation is the way of the future—an iPhone recommends apps to open, shopping apps show the most likely purchases, computer programs perform calculations in seconds that once took years. However, one area that has not seen a huge increase in digital automation is the aptly named automobile industry. While almost 150 years has passed since the birth of the automobile, for the most part, not much has changed. The two main components are the vehicle and the all-important driver within. Soon, that may change.

People get distracted. In many cases, people are always distracted. But it’s often not before these people get behind the wheel of a vehicle capable of reaching speeds topping a hundred miles per hour that this becomes an issue, leading to death and destruction on the roadways. Whenever people are involved, mistakes are inevitable. Self-Driving cars aim to solve this problem—putting the roadways firmly in the hands of advanced systems, safely controlling and regulating travel with every turn of the wheel.  But are we as a people willing to put our lives in the hand of an emotionless system? —A system carrying us at high speeds through the dangers of the outside world.

Technology has problems–phones crash, batteries die, software bugs can ruin an entire network, hackers can take control of computers from across the globe. While these flaws in devices can cause mayhem, they generally don’t result in the user dying. When you’re in the car but the car is doing the driving not you, these “problems” suddenly become life threatening. Nothing is perfect and paying possibly exorbitant amounts of money to be driven around by a potentially flawed machine could be a mistake, possibly the last one ever made.
Humanity takes chances every day in order to make their lives as easy as possible. Without risk there would be no progress. And, as mankind has progressed socially as well as technologically, the amount of risk afforded to each individual has decreased significantly even in the most extreme of circumstances. Every opportunity which helps save lives should be considered, and when said action also provides an easier method of progressing through the day it is nigh-insane to not consider it. Much like the automation of phones, laptops, high-level financial systems, and much more, cars must one day become devoid of the control of their biggest flaw, drivers. 

People make mistakes, machines don’t, unless they are programmed that way. And the only way to eliminate the mistakes of these programs is to allow them on the open road. Yes, flaws will be found, mistakes will happen, but with the caution shown by early adopters to self-driving cars, these mistakes will have safeties in place to prevent them from causing catastrophe. More importantly, the upside to a world of automated cars is huge. No more accidents, each car communicating with the other vehicles around it in ways unimaginable to the obliviousness of current drivers. This is the future, and like other tech before it, the only way to reach the future is to embrace it.

Con - ""Since Google is currently at the helm of development for the cars, other auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars in the event that Google's version takes off."" It's interesting that auto manufacturers see self-driving cars as a threat to their own makes and models.","Self-driving cars are starting to become a popular subject for debate in today’s world. The article, “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” addresses the pros and cons of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars help avoid driver error on the road and allow people to travel in comfort. Self-driving cars would help prevent driver error on the road. Many vehicle accidents today have a lot to do with the driver not being focused and alert on the road. Drunk and drugged accidents would never occur. They would allow people to be able to sleep or rest during long-distance journeys. However, they can also be dangerous because any sort of technology has the possibility of malfunctioning. That being said, a driver would most likely still have to be present to operate and monitor the car. Also, it was cost a fortunate to make these cars, as they would need special and expensive parts. 
I am personally against self-driving cars, and realistically do not benefit society. As mentioned earlier, self-driving cars would not only be expensive to make, but would most likely be of out the price range of many everyday people. Affordability for the rising middle class would be a big issue. Many truck drivers, bus/taxi drivers, and other forms of public transportation would slowly decrease and thus cause many to lose their jobs. And since we are dealing with technology, there is the possibly of malfunctions and glitches that could cause even more dangerous and fatal situations than human error could. If there was an accident, who would take the blame: the “driver” or the software system? As the article states, “there's no legal precedent for how a case would be handled. The difficult question of who holds responsibility in a car accident- the driver? The car manufacturer? The software developer? Could be tricky to answer.” There are also problems with self-driving cars functioning in specific types of weather. Weather patterns of heavy rain or snow can interfere with sensors in the car and distort car’s perception. The cars may not be able to understand certain road signs. Many states have specific road signs and laws that the software may not be able to identify and respond correctly to. “A good example is the difference between states regarding turning right on red. The computers could have difficulty identifying the different local and state rules with regard to the road.”
In conclusion, self-driving cars are not beneficial to society. As stated earlier, self-driving cars would only increase the risk of accidents, increase the unemployment rate, and potentially confuse and complicate things on the road. It is better to prevent all of this from occurring by not allowing self-driving cars.

One of the most fundamental aspects of self-driving cars is that they are the ‘ideal motorist.’ As 81% of vehicular accidents are a result of human error, self-driving technology virtually eradicates the risk of a crash occurring because of human causes. Opposingly, a con associated with self-driving technology is the cost to manufacture and purchase vehicles with the technology. High costs could result in the typical person not having access to the ‘safer’ vehicles in the first place. I found this pro and con to be of interest as they revealed the potential self-driving technology has for both the well-being and destruction of society as we know it.","         According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, nearly 81% of vehicular accidents occur as a direct result of human error. In recent years, this has caused many people to question whether self-driving technology can eliminate this risk- potentially saving countless lives. Other argue that entrusting human lives to technology will not suffice. However, it is crucial to understand the pros and cons of self-driving vehicles in order to make an informed decision as to whether they will benefit our society.
         First and foremost, self-driving technology virtually eradicates the risk of a vehicular accident caused by human error. Less accidents will result in public institutions, predominantly healthcare and insurance companies, saving money. Even further, public safety officials and law enforcement officers will spend less time dealing with car accidents. This will enable them to shift their focus towards more serious crimes, therefore keeping local communities a more safe environment for everyone. Along with this, many people value the personal time they will save with self-driving vehicles. Without having to focus on navigating the roads, passengers are encouraged to accomplish more behind the wheel than every before.
        Despite the numerous positive aspects of self-driving vehicles, many argue that this technology will not be beneficial to society. To begin, both the time and cost associated with teaching people to utilized the technology itself is inconceivable. Coinciding with this is the cost to manufacture the technology that makes purchasing it difficult for even middle class citizens. As many people would not have access to the technology for many years, if at all, vehicular accidents as a result of human error will still occur on roadways. 
     Although many believe that self-driving technology will catapult society into the future, I find that it will do just the opposite. Self-driving vehicles will be virtually inaccessible to the masses. Furthermore, if the technology fails, other drivers are put at risk. It can be argued that the time saved behind the wheel will be worth this risk, but, is encouraging laziness worthy goal to strive after? Self-driving technology promotes a decline in human-interaction and self- sufficiency as drivers would no longer be held accountable for their vehicles. 
       Conclusively, self-driving vehicles hold more uncertainty than promise for the future of society. Although time and money may be saved initially in minute amounts, the long term prosperity of this technology is not promising. So, next time you are sitting behind the wheel of your car, think about whether or not you’d entrust your life and the lives of those you love to technology. Would you?  ",

I find this interesting because it is true that technology is not prone to human behaviors, but at the same time there are limitations to machines that only humans possess.
One con stated in the article is the possibility of self-driving cars robbing people of the ability to drive, or more precisely their ""know-how."" I feel this may be unnecessary as a con, which is why I find it interesting to be listed as one.  ","There are many advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars. Those who argue for them state that so long as a human is behind the wheel, there is bound to be an accident due to the error in human judgement or distraction. Furthermore, costs are saved in insurance as more careful robot drivers replace their human counterparts. Many other factors, from the potential to eliminate traffic and congestion to assisting disabled people with their travels, are listed as ways in which autonomous driving can shape the future positively.

Disadvantages of the self-driving cars, however, are also myriad. They are composed of expensive components, with costs likely to be paid by the consumer. There is the question of the durability of both the components and the network; could a self-driving car operate should snow cover its sensors, or if malicious hackers seek to exploit the algorithm? And what of privacy concerns, as the car requires enormous quantities of data to localize itself?

As technology evolves to replace more and more aspects of society, from automated manufacturing jobs to long-distance communications, there lies a question not of how far one CAN go in replacing humans, but rather how far one SHOULD go in doing so. One key field in which this back-and-forth takes place is in the realm of autonomous driving; Self-driving cars take the wheel and leave passengers with little more than blind faith in the algorithms that guide them. 

The question of ""should"" rears its head here as tech companies from Google to Tesla demonstrate bigger and better ways for cars to pilot themselves. But while all the fancy LIDARS and IMUs show the feasibility of this nascent industry, is it really necessary to have the self-driving car? We are constantly bombarded with the statistics that human drivers are killed by human negligence, but what demand is there from consumers themselves?

I for one do not believe that self-driving cars are a benefit to society. By buying in we place our lives in the hands of for-profit companies who use nothing more than a ""greater good"" argument to completely take control away from man and place it entirely in the hands (or more accurately chipset) of a machine tied to a network. While motor vehicle deaths may be the fault of human ability, advances in automobile safety, and the laws that govern the roads we drive on, have drastically decreased the fatality count over the last decade. If funds were spent to continue improving safety mechanisms, rather than on reinventing the wheel with expensive and unproven self-driving cars, then we may find that equilibrium between technological advances and being able to drive ourselves places without over-reliance on a computer. 

Society as a whole will be extremely vulnerable if ""progress"" is an ever-increasing dependency on an all-encompassing ""network."" One broken link in the chain, and everything can very-well go to hell. The increasing ability for nefarious actors to cause chaos in society via technology was on full display during the 2016 election season, yet proponents of the self-driving car insists that technology is STILL not embedded deeply enough in our lives. There are limits to how much one can trust tech to do the right thing; operating a high-speed vehicle with life-threatening consequences is one of them.      ",

I thought that this specific pro was interesting because it directly stated the solution to the primary reason for automobile accidents.  Because a computer of a self-driving car cannot be distracted, an accident is less likely to occur because of human error.  The con of self-driving cars that I found interesting was number 5.  This would be one of the main reasons as to why I would be hesitant to purchase a self-driving car.  In order for the computer of the car to drive, in the process it would have to collect some personal data about the driver.  The question then becomes, what is the limit as to where that computer will stop gathering personal information  about the driver?  As a driver, this would be of major concern to me and is a prominent reason as to why I would probably not purchase a self-driving car.  ","As the years go by, our society, especially American society, continues to reach farther and farther into the future.  One of the up-and-coming debates of recent years is self-driving cars.  While they are still in their infancy, self-driving cars have both potential advantages and disadvantages for future use.  Some of the advantages include a reduction in motor vehicle accidents for the general population.  There are many reasons as to why this may occur.  First, there are no opportunities for a computer to become distracted while driving.  Another reason is that a computer uses several different complicated algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle, and plenty of other data that would decrease the chances of a car accident dramatically.  Self-driving cars would also be beneficial for disabled individuals who mainly have to rely on public transportation or assistance to get around.  While the self-driving car has its advantages, it also has disadvantages as well.  The cost of implementing self-driving cars is tremendous and possibly too much for the individual citizen to be able to pay for.  Along with the cost, there is the implication that if self-driving cars are adopted and widely used, this could have a negative impact on public transportation that was already in existence.  For example, taxi drivers, buses, etc.  Furthermore, self-driving cars have a lot of unknowns simply because they haven't been put out for widespread use in our society.  
I think that self-driving cars, if implemented correctly would be a good thing to push society further into the future.  However, at this stage self-driving cars are not beneficial to society.  Ideally, cars that are controlled by computers could reduce accidents.  With that said, there are so many unknowns that, at this point, would not be beneficial to society.  For example, one of the cons for self-driving cars is adaptation.  It's unclear as to how self-driving cars would maneuver through roadblocks or unique local driving laws.  Computers could have difficulty identifying the different local and state rules with regard to the road.  Another issue for self-driving cars is reliability.  If I'm going to put my life in the hands of a self-driving car, personally I would need to know that it is guaranteed not to malfunction.  As of now, there's no guarantee.  The main point for the counter argument for self-driving cars being beneficial to society is that it will reduce accidents.  However, I don't see that as a strong point.  There's absolutely no guarantee that accidents will be reduced because there is no evidence that the computer in the self-driving car would be able to adapt to certain conditions that might cause an accident.  Further, isn't it a possibility for computers to still make mistakes?  With this said, while self-driving cars may be beneficial to society at some point down the road, there still needs to be a lot more testing done to ensure and fully guarantee the safety of passengers.  As of now, with so many unknown problems, self-driving cars are not beneficial to society.",

Having a computer drive would eliminate accidents caused by human error. Since a large percentage of accidents are due to human error, by allowing machines to drive would significantly reduce the number of accidents.


Con:
There would be a lack of practice on the driver should they frequently make use of self driving cars. If the technology fail and the driver needs to take the wheel, the lack of practice may hinder the drivers ability to drive, resulting in a higher likely chance that accidents may happen.","Self driving cars have become the craze of the  new world. Not only would they be fuel efficient and reduce the number of accidents on the road, it would also allow the driver the opportunity to interact with their friends in the car instead of focusing on the road. Transportation by car would instead be similar to a train where you can leisurely admire the view and chat with friends while you cruise towards the destination. However, self driving cars are not infallible. Leaving our lives to the decisions of a machine is no simple task. Should the technology  fail, will the drivers who lack practice be able to handle the situation. Being suddenly thrown into such a situation would cause the driver to panic and be more prone to causing accidents.

Self driving cars are the way to the future. It would greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road. As a large percentage of road accidents are attributed to human error, by employing cars, we will eliminate the human error which is the key cause of many road accidents that occur today. By taking the human out of driving, there will be less chances of misjudgements because a machine does what it is programmed. Self driving vehicles also help to prevent traffic jams. Many times traffic jams occur because of all the cars tailgating each other. They are so close that they have to keep starting and stopping, resulting in a traffic jam. Machines would be able to determine the optimum speed and distance to keep the flow of traffic on track. This combined with the safe distances self driving cars would maintain, would not only reduce accidents but improve traffic conditions too.

However, our current technology is not as accurate as it could be. Sometimes whenever we follow the GPS to get to our destination, it will point us down a dead end. Furthermore, whenever there are overlapping roads, the GPS is unable to identify which road we are on and would give conflicting instructions. GPS also do not work underground and in tunnels, affecting available routes of self driving cars. The current technology is not advance enough for self driving cars to be truly self sufficient. This would result in an inexperience driver being thrown onto the wheel at any moment notice, which would greatly increase the risk of accidents occuring. These technology to build a accurate self driving car would cause the cost of purchasing these car to be astronomical. It would be a luxury item in which only the rich can afford. This would limit the number of self driving cars on the road and affect the accuracy of driving as self driving cars rely upon information provided by other self driving cars. That means that the more self driving cars are on the road, the better self driving cars will perfom. Thus with such a high  barrier of entry and no current advantage now, self driving cars would not be a very viable option.

Overall, self driving cars are a good step ahead but unless the level of technology improves in price and accuracy, it would only be a fairytale.",

I’m curious as to how many people this would affect, especially since I know a decent amount of people who have no physical, but mental disorders that can also affect their abilities to drive. For instance, I don’t want someone with chronic insomnia or sleep apnea behind the wheel, because they would be distracted all the time. I also found it interesting that one of the cons of having cars that drive themselves is who to blame when there is a car accident. I think that people, especially Americans, tend to point fingers when it comes to car accidents, but one of the key reasons no one should be blamed in the first place is in the name itself: its an accident. I think this may not be so much of a con after all. 
","	Whenever a new and better thing comes around, people tend to reject it for the comfort of familiarity. This is the case for one of the new, hot topics in today’s world: the self-driving car. At first, a self-driving car seems like it can’t possibly be practical, for how could technology account for everything that a human does when making driving decisions? However, advanced algorithms can negate some of the human error when making these kinds of driving decisions, and it’s possible that someday these self driving cars will be familiar. 
	Every year 33,000 people die in car crashes and many of these are caused by distracted driving. These could result from obvious distractions like texting and driving all the way to non-obvious distraction such as being tired after a long day’s work or finding a spider hanging from the inside of your car. Either way, likelihood is that you or someone you know has been distracted while driving before, and it may cost them, or the people who surround them, to lose their life. Self-driving cars don’t have the ability to become distracted. They have preset algorithms that tell them the right following distance and the correct stopping time. When 4 in 5 crashes are due to human error, self-driving cars have the potential to bring this mortality rate down tremendously.
	Now, while they can bring down this mortality rate, they aren’t without fault. For one, self-driving cars would put Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers out of business, potentially damaging the economy. Also, most of these cars will be electric, which can cause further loss of money through gas companies. However, many of these costs would be offset by the saving of many human lives, which the US treasury has estimated to be worth $9.2 million a piece. Also, electric cars may already be a thing of the future due to the rising need for eco-friendly resources in light of the planet’s warming climate. Some downfalls of self-driving cars cannot be disputed, however. Some of the advanced computer algorithms and technology cannot withstand extreme weather or account for human traffic signals when there is a light down or a road blocked. Also, many of these cars rely on GPS signal, which isn’t always received well in all corners of the world. Lastly, most of these cars are outside of the average American’s budget, which means only the elite would have them, but they work better when more people have them. 
	While self-driving cars may be a thing of the future, Google or any company that will make them, definitely needs to test and reconstruct models of the cars that don’t work out many of the issues mentioned above. Self-driving cars have the potential to save so many lives and so many hours of driving time, but until they are completely safe, they shouldn’t be released to the public.

    The benefit of streamlining traffic in congested areas would be highly appealing to anyone who has sat through rush hour on their daily commute. ""Platooning"" could save time, gas, and sanity for everyone. However, on the flip side, GPS is an imperfect system that could lead to many accidents and problems. Wrong turns, glitches, and a plethora of other problems might threaten a fleet of self-driving vehicles. A certain episode of ""The Office"" where Michael's car ended up in the lake comes to mind.","The forward march of technology has always been a source of controversy for society. Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slates with pencil and paper in schoolhouses was a shift that created public dialogue. It is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is exciting, highlighting our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but the application of it in our day to day lives presents many important questions that first need answering.
     Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will be able to have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because computers have one thing to focus on. They don't worried about the kids, their date, or their finances like humans do, nor can they get drunk or distracted. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more, which would all add together into a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might cease to exist! Insurance and healthcare costs would decrease with less accidents as well, and these companies might even be forced to establish a new business model. 
     However, there is always more than one side to an argument. There are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. ""Trolley problems"", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology that can be hacked and have some of their functions remotely controlled. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Rainstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them, which is a problem is that system can't see roads. 
     There are so many angles on this problem that its probably a good thing we are still a ways off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but I also see the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they become standard. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of someone else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave of pushing our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for a collective change that takes away our own individual cars and replaces them with devices that have no character. I say wait a decade and see where the technology has gone.

Computers' attention doesn't get split trying to change the radio station, their vision doesn't stray to look at an interesting billboard, and they don't get distracted by conversation with passengers. Simply put, computers do not directly make human errors.

Con: This safety benefit will only happen when a critical mass of cars on the road. When human and self-driving cars interact, there is still a great potential for accident, errors, and fatalities. If self-driving cars aren't adopted widely, the benefit becomes moot.","Proponents of self-driving cars point to the benefits to those who are unable to drive due to a physical or mental disability, potential elimination of urban traffic, and an overwhelming reduction in collisions, injuries, and fatalities from driver error. However, there exist many groups of self-driving skeptics: those who argue the cost of self-driving technology is out of reach except for the very wealthy, those who are concerned of the potential for software bugs and even malicious hacking, and those who are simply concerned about the psychological effects of a driver handing control over a large machine to a computer. 

Perhaps the most compelling counterargument is one from critical mass; the benefits of self-driving cars, in terms of cost, time, and lives, are only noticeable when adoption thereof is widespread enough that human drivers simply aren't a major factor. The issue here is the time it takes to reach that critical point. The cost of self-driving cars, even when tempered by economies of scale, is still significant enough to consider here.

Let's do a cost-benefit analysis: even the most hardened skeptic would have to agree that the economic cost of self-driving car adoption would be worth it to reduce the approximately 40,000 deaths due to automobiles. However, this analysis does not tell the full picture. The cost will be incurred largely up-front: businesses changing their shipping fleets to self-driving cars, manufacturers changing their workflows and machinery, and individual car-buyers purchasing a self-driving car for personal gain, rather than higher-minded societal ideals.

The benefit, however, is more tenuous. The largest benefits in speed, convenience, and safety come when the majority of cars on the road are self-driving. It is at that point that the effect of human error dramatically lowers, and the algorithms are able to navigate safely and predict how other cars on the road will drive as well. A self-driving, networked city has no need for traffic lights: the cars can simply decide among themselves when to go. But a city where only 25% of the cars are self-driving is still tied to comparatively ancient technology.

I wouldn't say that I'm taking a hard-lined stance to the negative; rather, I'm simply pragmatic about the costs and skeptical of the benefits immediately. As the cost lowers over time, the marginal benefits of individual ownership grow, and adoption of self-driving cars at that point is a no-brainer. But the incentives for adoption now are not as clear.",

Drunk driving makes up a big part in auto fatalities. If a computer can assure that someone's love one will make home safe even if they are a little intoxicated, I am all for it. On the other hand, one con that I found interesting is that the cars rely on traffic signals. That is a huge hazard because when the weather gets bad, police officers often direct traffic. Although drunk driving fatalities would be kept to a minimum, other accidents will arise due to the computer not recognizing human signals. ","          Technology in the automotive sector is developing rapidly. A popular area is the idea of having self-driving cars. In short, these self-driving cars will use many sensors to detect the environment that it is in then it will use the information gathered to navigate passengers to their desired destination without the need for human interaction. One of the main reasons behind the idea of self-driving cars is the fact that these cars will help to decrease automotive accidents ranging from distractedness while driving, driving under the influence, etc. On the other hand, the costs outweigh the benefits. At the moment, engineering, computer requirements, software, and sensors add up to more than $100,000. Self-driving cars would not be a better alternative to human-driving cars because the risks outweigh the benefits.
 
          Although self-driving cars are talked about vastly, many people fail to realize the safety issues that would go along with the car. This car may reduce the risks of accidents however, it does not eliminate them altogether. What if you are in a situation where the computer system begins to glitch? This could put a driver in an even dangerous situation than when he or she would be driving themselves. As we all know, the GPS system is not always reliable. There have been times when a GPS has taken me to a street that doesn’t exist and my human intuition told me to turn around. How will this self-driving car know when to turn around or will it continue to go deeper and deeper into an area that may not even be safe? In addition to that, the self-driving cars are not equipped to operate in bad weather conditions. The bad weather messes with the sensors, so in actuality when weather is bad, the passenger will probably have to drive their self. As stated earlier, these cars are very costly. These care are most likely marketed towards a more elite class. However, the lower and middle class citizens are the people that buy things that are affordable and they help to keep businesses going. So in order to assure that this idea takes off, salespeople have to market to the correct segment of people. To make sure that sales go as planned, designers of the cars need to thoroughly find mistakes before insisting that humans entrust a programmed computer system with their lives. 

          To conclude, self-driving cars are not a great alternative when being compared to human drivers. They are way more dangerous and not as reliable as normal cars. The heavy use on digital maps is con because you may potentially end up in an area where you did not want to go and they are of too much cost to the lower-class citizens. I would propose the solution of not implementing self-driving cars. You will see a certain kind of accident decrease (drunk-driving) but on the other hand, glitches in the system and not being able to detect human signals will cause a rise in system-related accidents. The solution to this problem is to stick with human drivers. The saying goes, “If it ain't broke, don’t try to fix it"". We have survived thus far with human drivers so I think we'll continue to manage.",

Not every argument was equal in measure, but there were two key points that stick out in my mind. On the pro side of the debate, the idea that 81% of accidents occur from human error seems to tilt the stage towards the pro side. Technology and computers have taken over many areas of the economy due to their precision and efficiency. However, this technology comes at a steep price of 100,000 dollars. The average American makes only 60,000 dollars annually. Both statements seem very even. ","   Technology remains to be the nourishment of civilizations. Over the years, most societies developed new innovative ideas to make the human experience easier and more efficient. In the earlier years of our human history, technology meant wheels and ships that could safely travel for a day. Now, in the age of the technological boom, innovators have been racing for new patents that have been scarcely imagined in science fiction. For instance, hover boards used to be interesting props used in the blockbuster film, Back to the Future, to make the year 2015 seem futuristic and evolved. Now, hover boards are used to entertain the public with their spectacular, flaming explosions on the internet. Does the self-driving car have the same fiery fate? Or will it soar above everyone's expectations like the Wright Brother's airplane? 

   For starters, this technology can add up to over 100,000 dollars for the entirety of the system. The average American has a salary of about 60,000. So, that car would be worth almost two American salaries. Another idea that strikes a cord would be that there are glitches with mechanics everyday that the average person can not fix on their own.The GPS computer system has never been 100% accurate. Even human hackers could play with lives in their hands if the urge struck them. Finally, there are so many every day problems that could interfere with the potential technology like stop light failures and local driving laws unique to certain areas. Many jobs that human drivers would have been lost to computers who don't need it. In the instance of self-driving cars, the cons make decent points. 

   However, the pros outweigh the cons by far. Of course, the technology will cost more when it first arrives. Calculators used be 395 dollars when they first came out on to the market. When the industry begins to mass produce, the cost will steadily decrease if demand stays constant. Also, 81% of accidents occur due to human error. Machines have been replacing human mistakes in other areas of life in the medical and industrial fields. This area of life could use machine constancy to save human lives, insurance money, medical bills, and time if instituted correctly. There can be higher speed limits if computers typically drive safely which increases efficiency. The driving car can even take care of the needy. Now, the elderly and people with  disabilities can have cars which can save their time and independence. For instance, remember the airplane? It could barely hold one person aloft and was made of flammable wood. Now, airports and flights are integral parts of the worlds of business and leisure. Not to mention that most of the cons dealt with the loss of human jobs in the driving, gasoline, and lawyer businesses. But, the technology has to be assembled and programmed by man. There will be easier to difficult jobs that would pay well if the practice takes off. 

   All in all, the pros seem to handily overcome the cons. The cons start with advantages in the initial staging of production that has to due with overpricing, possible and unpredictable mechanical failure, and substantial job loss. However, technology can become cheaper with mass production, reduce the considerable human error in accidents, save time, money, and lives, and can improve the lives of the dependent. Jobs can emerge in the expanding field as has happened in the past. Technology needs time to become refined and protected before a life can be tested. But if that big, bulky plane can be navigated and depended on by a computer GPS, then why not the automobile?",

This behavior essentially couples vehicles together as a way to increase road capacity and potentially decrease congestion significantly, especially for cities with high volumes of traffic during rush hour. This concept could dramatically cut travel time for the majority of commuters and could help increase productivity by providing professionals more time to work. On the other hand, the likelihood of this software being affordable for the majority of those commuting for 9-5 jobs is low, at least for now. The issue of affordability for this software could be overcome, but it is definitely one of the key obstacles in allowing self-driving cars to dominate the roadways.   ","The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets since the public sphere became aware of the role these futuristic vehicles could play in the not-to-distant future. First, there are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advanced machinery could have on modern life. These potential issues include the sheer cost of the software, the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car, as well as the security risks of the software itself. The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits. For instance, in California, people purchasing new electric vehicles can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500 depending on the size of the car's battery, and we could see a similar incentive allotted to self-driving cars in the future as their software has the potential to greatly decrease car insurance costs. Other skeptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where traffic signals have failed and police move to the intersection to direct traffic. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch that would allow a driver to take control of the wheel for a period of time so the driver may avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. The potential for the software to be targeted by hackers is another real issue that could become a major problem if the software isn't adequately protected. However, as long as information identifying the owner of each vehicle is kept separate from the car's computer software and the software that controls the cars is linked to a kill switch that could safely pull the car off the road and alert the driver, any substantial damage associated with this threat could be minimized even though the potential to completely protect from it is limited. There are, however, many advantages that I believe outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation within the car, or events happening outside, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be less responsible for people to purchase car insurance and manufacturers who are making vast amounts of money from car sales could cover the cost of the insurance, which would provide consumers with more money to use in the market. Lastly, the potential of platooning and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to due to their inability to operate a vehicle. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives, as long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution.  ",

I found the positives of self-driving cars to be interesting in the fact of how they can monumentally improve the safety and efficiency of society.
The negative aspects of self-driving cars include how it will reduce jobs, become too expensive, and the legalities regarding any accidents that do occur. I found the negatives of self-driving cars to be interesting in the fact that they will be too difficult to implement and the legalities regarding such an implementation. ","            Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years. However, there is still a fierce debate to whether these cars will do more harm than good. Some believe that the development of these cars is the key for a successful future. Some people believe this because of how self-driving cars will reduce the likelihood of accidents as 81% of accidents are due to human error, make transportation more available for disabled people, and maximize efficiency as police/first responders can deal with other emergencies instead of auto-related incidents. While there are many people that support such cars, there are others that are dead against it. The main reasons why people are against self-driving cars include the difficulty of implementation, mostly due to price, and the many troubles and hassles that will arise after implementation.
            After a thorough analysis of the benefits and problems of self-driving cars, I believe that the problems outweigh the benefits. One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be to buy once they hit commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car. With a projected average price of $100,000, the majority of Americans will not be able to afford these cars. Thus, the production of self-driving cars, no matter the benefits, will not help society if only the very wealthy are able to afford them.
           Another reason why the problems with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits is the amount of disruption it will cause to society. With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, such as trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on such vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job which is not a guarantee. If they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, hurting the economy drastically and possibly increasing crime.
            The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked. With this idea a great possibility, the safety benefit of self-driving cars is compromised. Hackers can hack the cars so that they will crash or drive off a bridge. With the main benefit of self-driving cars, safety, being so easy to be compromised, self-driving cars cause more problems than solutions.
            To conclude, self-driving cars are not a benefit to society. This because they cost too much for the average person to buy, will put many people out of jobs, damaging the economy and increasing crime, and being susceptible to hacking. ",

I am not surprised by that statistic, but it is a compelling argument to garner support for self-driving cars. At the same time, we must consider that maybe there will be a new and equally condemning statistic about accidents due to computer error. The most interesting con, in my opinion, is #3. This item informs us that we cannot access most of the benefits of self-driving cars without their widespread use, and with the cost exceeding $100,000 (item #2) it is not at all likely that this will be the case.","Of the numerous advantages to self-driving cars, the most notable include the elimination of human error and distracted driving, which together make up a majority of car accidents; redistributing the time people spend driving to other tasks, such as reading, chatting, and eating; and providing a safe and independent mode of transportation for people with disabilities, elderly adults who can no longer drive, and intoxicated individuals. On the other hand, the price, security risks, and potential flaws and incapabilities in cases of failure of traffic signals, inclement weather, and inaccuracy of GPS mapping, upon which self-driving cars rely, all provide compelling evidence against the case for self-driving cars.

A large consideration, especially with new advances in technology, is the safety of our personal information as consumers. Self-driving cars would be of utmost interest to hackers and large corporations due to their collection of personal data. Further, because of the $100,000 price point, the benefits of self-driving cars, specifically the claim that car accidents due to human error will decrease, can never be attained. In order for self-driving cars to thrive, they must be the majority on the road, and based on the current socioeconomic climate in the United States, this will never be the case.

While one could argue that in situations such as hazardous driving conditions or failure of automated traffic signals, a quick and simple way of switching to a manual driver mode would eliminate these problems, drivers may not respond quickly enough to the situation, particularly if they are using their newfound free time to eat, talk, or read, or if they have an impairment due to age, ability-level, or intoxication, that would prohibit their ability to drive in the first place. In the case of GPS inaccuracy, which many users can attest to, a driver may not realize that the car is taking them in the wrong direction. Moreover, the situation can increase in danger if the car tries to turn down a one-way street or avoid a road that does not appear to exist in the data. 

Overall, the risks associated with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits. Despite the luxury of enjoying more free time and increased accessibility to owning a car, self-driving cars are not a reliable mode of transportation. They are vulnerable to hackers, machine-error due to the lack of reliability of GPS mapping, and are not projected to decrease accidents until their use is widespread which due to their exorbitant pricing is not likely to happen in the near or distant future.",

This, in turn, can reduce the number of car accidents. As a result, implementing self-driving cars can not only benefit economy by saving related cost but also save priceless lives. One disadvantage of self-driving cars is that the technology is not fully developed or substantiated yet. There are still circumstances, such as extreme weather conditions, that optimal function of self-driving cars may be compromised. Under these situations, self-driving cars are no better than human drivers.","What do Google, Tesla and Uber seem to be drawn to over recent years? Self-driving cars. 
The technology seems to be premature for everyday life yet as several headlines were made after self-driving cars crashed, eventually leading Uber to pull out of self-driving service. Self-driving cars appear to suffer in circumstances that significantly deviate from programmed conditions, such as lack of GPS information to guide the road or extreme weather conditions that prevent visualization of the road. However, it is important to point out that these are limitations. These factors should not stop and abandon the progress that has been made in this technology. 
Self-driving cars can become advantageous. While glitch in a self-driving system is dangerous and risks driver's life, this problem is inherent in any automobiles, even those that are not self-driving. Several renowned automobile companies like GM, Volkswagen and Audi issued major recall because of brake problems, which put numerous drivers at life threatening danger. For self-driving cars, if the problem can be quickly addressed by software update, without having to recall all the automobiles. This can not only save money and resource from the automobile company but also time and inconvenience that a driver has to experience. Additionally, self-driving cars can save lives. Countless number of car accidents arise from distractions ranging from Coors Light to Instagram. Self-driving cars can free drivers from these distractions, providing safe conditions for both drivers and pedestrians. Furthermore, as any technological advances have proved in the past, self-driving technology is a utility that will save time from mundane and expendable daily activity. It can boost productivity in individuals because they can put time that was spent on driving on alternative activity. Likewise, self-driving cars can reduce costs commonly associated with automobile nowadays. Self-driving cars are automated. They are less likely to suffer from individual variability of drivers and can reduce common outcomes resulting from these individual differences, such as heavy traffic and sparse parking space. Due to its programmed function, self-driving cars can make driving during rush hour less painful or even non-existent. 
Once self-driving technology becomes more mature and developed, this can greatly enhance everyday life of both drivers and non-drivers, reliving burdens arising from heavy traffics and accidents, and most importantly saving lives. Even though some may argue that this technology will make driver's ed obsolete, if it makes drinking and driving education and its appalling videos around prom season obsolete, it might worth the transition.

This reduces the time and effort one needs to put in taking care of the disabled people. They can be more independent.
While at the same time, people will need to learn how to operate the system safely. Also, it is highly possible for technology to fail. In that case, one will have to learn to handle such problems effectively.
","    With the ever-increasing number road accidents, there has been a push towards developing a technology that is safer and can make accidents less likely. Since most of the accidents are caused due to distracted driving, technologists are driven to develop self-driving cars. However, it is still not certain whether self-driving cars are really that beneficial to society.
    
    Self-driving cars offer a lot of freedom to the drivers to do other tasks while commuting. Drunk-driving will be a past. Disabled people will not have to depend on anyone else to commute. Owing to their platooning behaviour and complex algorithms to control the distance between two cars, it is believed that self-driving cars will reduce the occurrence of road accidents. Although self-driving cars offer so many advantages, there are numerous disadvantages as well. With the new self-driving technology, unemployment rates will rise, the gasoline industry will be hit. These cars are very expensive. There are high chances of technology failure and thus it is not guaranteed that self-driving cars will be safer.

    In my opinion, self-driving cars, in general, will be not be so beneficial for society. The one reason why we would encourage this technology is that it will make the life of commuters very easy by reducing the commute time by reducing congestion, allowing them to do other important tasks while travelling, reducing their dependability on others or public transport, reducing efforts to learn driving, reducing the need for parking spaces, etc. 

    However, there are numerous reasons why we shouldn't. Self-driving cars work completely on computer technology, sensors and GPS tracking. In a situation when any one of these fails, there is a threat for a huge accident to occur. If the vehicle is moving at a high speed and the sensors are not able to detect an obstacle very near to the vehicle it will be an accident. Most of the times, GPS is not very accurate. For example, in a city named Pittsburgh, there are numerous GPS trackers on staircases which are detected and recommended as the shortest route. You cannot avoid these unless the computer knows about the presence of such pseudo roads. All such instances will lead to an accident.

   Also, self-driven cars will lead to a sharp drop in employment rates as taxi-drivers, driving educators, injury lawyers, insurance company employees will lose their jobs. The oil and gas industry will be hit since most of these cars are likely to be electric. This will have a tremendous effect on the economy.

   Although self-driven cars are very promising they are not the exact solution to reduce road accidents and make the commute safer.",

Pro to this topic means that I agree to the self-driving technology. And con to this topic means that I disagree with the self-driving technology. I choose con based on safety, job concerns, legal problems, and moral issues. Besides, during the first few decades, when the self-driving technology being adopted by only the pioneers, one could promise smell chaos on the street. More traffic problems and accidents will occur when people driving normal cars and people having self-driving cars met on the street. Also, the massive application of self-driving is still a very long way to go before the problem of expense being sort out.  ","The advantages of self-driving cars are obvious. First of all, it is convenient and friendly to all kinds of people. For example, people that don't like driving but have the need for transportation, elderly people, people with disability, and people who work late and might drive tiredly etc. And, talking about fatigue driving, the self-driving cars also takes care of the safety problem. Since the computer takes care of everything, the risk of traffic accidents should be reduced, theoretically speaking. Some study has shown that drivers are the primary causes in most of the accidents. Computers could also take care of other little things that bugging us while driving such as road planning, signs reading, distance keeping and so on.  Having computers has evidently improved many aspects of our lives, just like computers have improved our mailing, banking, shopping, and now driving.

But, computers do make mistakes, and when it does, everything is ruined. The most obvious problems for self-driving cars is also safety issues.  What if the car systems just crashed in the middle of the road? And when this happened, could the driver immediately take control the driving? When talking about safety, so many problems just arise naturally, and self-driving car system is not ready to answer all these or at least make the customers believe they could solve all these problems. What's more, if accidents do happen, who will take responsibility for the accidents? This is a moral problem and a legal problem. Also, after the introduction of self-driving cars, several markets will be shaken, and it sounds like a promising for countless oppositions.

Personally, I am against the idea of self-driving cars. But, I am not against to the idea of trying to inventing such products and maybe tried to test its use in small scale. Maybe at a science conference or something. Just to see to what degree science could do. What I am against is to massively introduce the self-driving car to the general public. First of all, it is the safety problem. We all know that computer systems (Windows, MAC OX etc.) sometimes crushed for no reason. We hate it, but there's only so much damage that could be done, but if the car computer system crash during the middle of the driving. What should the driver do? Old drivers all know that anything could happen on the road. So, what if there is a dangerous situation arise and the computer could not process the situation and need the drivers to make a quick, intuitive decision, could the driver just take over the control?  What's more, Legal problems will definitely stay around with self-driving cars. Who should be responsible for the accidents? What law should be implemented? There are so many questions and the public would love to take their own sides on these topics. It might trigger some unstable people to act extreme. 

And according to the reading package, the self-driving cars will have the best potential when more people are adopting it. But,  since AI robot takes over people is one of the most popular science themes in novels and movies, some people might afraid that the self-driving car system might do the same thing as the robots in the movie did. The prevalence of self-driving cars might take times, maybe too long. And I am afraid that the traffic will go into chaos before the prevalence reach to the cutpoint. 

Also, self-driving cars will take many people's jobs. These people, including taxi drivers, oil companies, car insurance companies might not willing to adopt self-driving cars. They are more likely to join the opposition team. The question is will the society hold up until the prevalence of self-driving cars reach to the point that it no longer haunt the peace and harmony of the society? ",

Since the technology-driven car is operated by complex algorithms and not humans, a fixed rate of speed can be maintained. Speeding or driving too slow will be a problem of the past, making higher speed limits safe and time efficient. 
Self-driving cars can be detrimental to society as technology can malfunction. When detectable technology like traffic lights fail to work, the self-driving car cannot recognize human signals or detours. For example, if a police officer directs traffic, the self-driving car will fail to interpret the direction.","As the number of fatalities from distracted and reckless driving increases, the need for safer roadways becomes a primary goal. Self-driving cars, a futuristic technology presently being developed and tested, has many advantages and disadvantages. With each side presently valid and convincing points, the debate over the benefit of self-driving cars in society rages on. In a technological driven world, the incorporation of self-driving vehicles seems likely. The question for the future of self-driving cars will be how many people will accept the new technology as a part of daily life and routine.  

Even though the idea of new technology involving self-driving cars can seem exciting and innovative, there are many disadvantages of widely accepting it in society. Since the technology is still being developed and tested, many people raise questions and concerns as to the self-driving car's safety and effectiveness. In terms of safety, should the vehicle get into an accident, the responsibility will be questionable. The technology itself, with large amounts of stored personal information incorporated within the software, could make people uneasy with worries of breaches in identity. In terms of overall effectiveness, the need for new education will become a reality. Current education standards including driver's education and behind-the-wheel could become virtually extinct should self-driving cars become widely adopted. In conjunction with the absence of active driving education, coordinative, peripheral, and basic driving skills will cease to be basic knowledge. These disadvantages, along with many others, can create negative associations and opinions of self-driving cars. 

WIth the goal of creating safer and more efficient roadways in mind, self-driving cars offer many advantages to potential consumers. The technology involved is very advanced, with many algorithms controlling the speed, direction, and destination of the vehicle. This computer, while controlling these driving factors, also eliminates bad driving behavior usually displayed by humans. These behaviors include, and are not limited to: speeding, drunk-driving, driving under the influence of drugs, and distracted driving. In relation to speeding, speed limits could increase with the increase of self-driving cars since the car controls the speed. Since these behaviors are eliminated, car insurance will decrease or cease to exist at all. When people are not spending time driving, they can spend time doing other things, like working, checking their phones, or any other activity that could not be done behind the wheel. These advantages, among others, are revolutionary to the open road as we now know it. 

Self-driving cars are not beneficial to society due to the nature of the technology. While there are about 33,000 fatalities annually on the roadways, most of the accidents could have been prevented. How? No distractive driving is good driving. Technology can and has failed, with reliance and dependence on it causing panic when it malfunctions. Unlike technology, people can make conscious choices when it comes to driving. These choices come from an effective education and legal system. Like education, laws would also have to be changed with the emergence of self-driving cars on the road; old rules would give rise to new, and more difficult to follow and retain, regulations. Self-driving cars in general are very new, with Google testing the product in a limited amount of states. Since Google is the main innovator in this field of technology, other car and gas companies could suffer economically from the rise of electric, self-driving vehicles. The likelihood that these cars will be adopted quickly is unlikely as people are subject to avoid change, especially changes in routine.

Distractions are a huge cause to unsafe driving conditions. Distracted drivers can not only harm themselves, but others as well. 

A con in the article that I found interesting was the one that states “the cost of implementing the new technology could be way out of the reach for most Americans. Currently, the engineering, power and computer requirements, software, and sensors add up to more than $100,000.” Basically, this con is stating that developing this technology, is not economically feasible and that the typical American could not afford it and that the operation would be too expensive. 
","
I take the affirmative position on self-driving cars. I chose side based on two positions. I think that they are safer and economically intelligent. I think that self-driving cars are beneficial to our society.  I examined the pro from the article stating that self-driving cars will eliminate distractions on the road. I chose a con, which in turn I believe supports my argument, that the aspects playing into the production of the self-driving cars can add up to more than $100,000 which based off the average income of an American, is expensive. However, I think that both these pros and cons help build my argument on why self-driving cars are beneficial to our society.

I think that they will not only keep the people within the vehicle more safe, but also, other drivers and their passengers on the road. I think that distractions are the main cause of unsafe driving. For example, texting and driving—this evolution, texting, started during my lifetime, became an issue on the road during my lifetime, and became illegal while driving during my lifetime. This seemed to me to be the quickest law procedure in history. Between the time when texting was born, to the time when it was banned on the road, was a very short span. This is because it caused a lot of accidents. However, this was just one of many distractions on the road. People are still allowed to talk on the phone, fiddle with their radio, mess with their GPS, yell at their kids, talk to their passengers, etc. There are still many distractions and the only way to eliminate this risk is to use a medium that cannot be distracted, a computer. 

My other standpoint is that self-driving cars are economically intelligent. The production of this technology, would create jobs. First we would need the engineers, the programmers, the physical creators, the advertises, the marketers, and sellers, and so on. Historically, every time a new technology is created, more jobs open up. To counteract the con that I pulled from the article, yes the cars will be expensive, but that I because whenever a new technology first comes out, it always starts out expensive but is then worked to a more affordable range. Think of iPhones for example, they started as a new technology, marketed to an unreasonable crowd, and now everyone has them.  This shows the common cycle of technology and how it will be helpful in the end.

 All in all, self-driving cars will eliminate distractions, making the roads safer and the rate of accidents lower, as well as enhance our economy.

Different from arguing about the characteristics of an independent self-driving car, this statement illustrates the significance of developing a communication network among all cars. Specifically, real-time information traffics and road risks can be swiftly distributed to the whole network. In this way, cars with ""intelligence"" can calculate the equilibrium and provide personalized navigations based on all the information collecting from passengers, road, and weather. 

Although we are not clear how far the self-driving cars can go, but I think to invest in such a network is valuable and promising. The network can connect all types of vehicles, as long as a shared information system is embedded in cars. Both passengers in self-driving cars and drivers who enjoy driving themselves will benefit from the real-time information exchange process. ","Debates on self-driving cars have attracted attention from society as a whole. From my perspective, users' adoption and acceptance, safety and privacy concerns, and economic impacts on the society are top concerns.

The self-driving car, ideally, can reduce accident rate on the road by overcoming the driving distraction problem. However, the actual performance will largely depend on the technology/algorithm. In addition, external factors including users' attitude towards automation and weather conditions are threats to self-driving experiences.

On the other hand, the economic impacts of self-driving cars on the society is a double-sided sword. Improving efficiency and reducing cost indicate many jobs in the
transportation sector will be eliminated. How can we design training programs to help low-income group (for example, taxi drivers) to develop new skills and rebuild their lives. 

Overall, I support to invest more resource in developing self-driving vehicles. 

Self-driving is not a recent concept. In fact, we are already enjoying the benefits from 'self-driving'. For example, Volvo cars can automatically stop if pedestrians are detected within a risky distance in front of the vehicle and the driver fail to react in time. Generally, there are five levels of self-driving cars, with automation level increased. The top level is fully-responsible self-driving cars, which is the mass impressions or imaginations on the self-driving. Whether we can achieve that goal is not clear. However, investing resource in building more intelligent and driver-friendly techniques are no doubt beneficial.

Besides allocating resource in researching the single-car based technologies, constructing a vehicle network system adds a significant value to our society. Specifically, real-time information traffics and road risks can be swiftly distributed to the whole network. In this way, cars with ""intelligence"" can calculate the equilibrium and provide personalized navigations based on all the information collecting from passengers, road, and weather. In order to develop such a communication system, the intelligence level of end-cars is essential. The radars, sensors, and software systems need to be designed as a team to process and transfer data within the car, and within the whole system.

When it comes to end-users or consumers, I do not think adoption aversion will be a big obstacle. First, as stated above, using self-driving cars is not a binary choice. Instead, consumers choose which level of self-driving they want to use, to increase their driving experiences. Second, human-based service is costly, whereas a machine-based service is economically efficient. For instance, we used to have to pay a consultant for tax reporting. Yet, we can now use various software to help us. Back to the case of the self-driving car, people can choose to hire a personal driver or taxi driver or choose to use a self-driving service. 

To sum up, self-driving services are already embedded in our driving experience. We are enjoying and will continue to enjoy the benefits brought by the development of technology. ",

Self-driving cars can be a major breakthrough in this direction as there can be no reason for the computers behind them to get distracted. ","With the increasing number of cars on the road and people becoming more careless about things, the number of fatalities due to accidents are also increasing. 
Even those who are the expert in driving, get into a false confidence and take it casually while driving. Moreover increasing amount of stress and getting engaged in alcohol or drugs among the young generation is common nowadays. All these results in distractions while driving and thus increasing the number of road accidents. 

Self-driving cars can bring revolution in this direction by ensuring safe and fully focussed driving every time. A computer works same behind the wheel every time it drives. It is not affected by the external distractions and neither it is overconfident any time. Every time, it drives, it will take the same precautions and drive with as much safety as the first time. Moreover, it learns from the others mistake, keeps every data to take further decisions. 

While commuting to work, most of the people have half of their mind over what deadlines they have to complete or what their boss may give him the break or not. In such cases, breaking traffic rules or getting distracted in between is common. With computer driving the car, this will no more be a problem and people can focus more on their important work even while traveling.
Even disabled people, who rely on others or public transport can commute from one place to other more easily.  

Half of the time of the police officer is wasted on tracking and keeping traffic rules, giving tickets to people and managing traffics. With self-driving cars on road, traffic rules will be followed more strictly and even keeping a track of every vehicle will then be easier as everything will be connected by computer. The police can then divert their focus to more serious crimes. 

The fuel consumption and hence the energy wastage can also be restricted by using self-driving cars. While people behave casually for turning off the engine while at lights or at stops, this can be easily controlled by computers. 

In all, we can conclude that using self-driving cars can be worthy in terms of saving lives, saving energy, saving time and will let us divert our mind to more important work rather than driving. It can solve the problem of road accidents, traffics and will provide a safe commute to pedestrians as well as to the passengers.

I find this interesting because I did not know that the value of a human, in the eyes of the US government, is nine point two million dollars. 
On the other hand, a “con” that I found interesting was that humans may no longer know how to drive after successful implementation of self-driving cars. To me, one important milestone in growing up for most Americans is learning to drive a car and earning their license. This amazing technology, if it works and is put into place into society, could remove this milestone from our lives, and make humans even more dependent on technology, which I find an interesting conundrum. While this would not be a problem in everyday life, I do believe that it would provide an intriguing barrier if and when technology fails. 
","Self-driving cars are the future. That’s what tech and driving companies like Uber and Google are telling us. However, self-driving cars present many barriers and disadvantages. Is it actually worth it to society to implement self-driving cars?

There are many benefits of self-driving cars. Humans are not perfect, but computers can be better than humans at one specified task – such as driving. Human error, especially from distractions at the wheel, is the main cause of car accidents, and use of computers will remove human error from the equation. In addition, computers can calculate when to stop, slow down or speed up, turn, and more, which is safer and more appropriate than a human’s quick guesstimate. Self-driving cars would reduce accidents, resulting in reduced health and insurance costs for society. 
In addition, these calculations could improve traffic, and allow people to have more time to do work or spend their time in more enjoyable ways while traveling instead of staring down a highway. Lastly, self-driving cars could help disabled individuals along with the larger public get around.

However, self-driving cars do have drawbacks. Humans would still need to know how to operate them, and cost of implementation is high. All of society would need to adopt the technology, and trust the technology, otherwise accidents would still occur. In addition, this technology would be at a high risk for hacking and private data breaches. Self-driving cars would also eliminate transportation sector jobs, impacting the economy. If an accident happened, who would be to blame? And if an accident did happen, how would the cars interpret human traffic signals, or would humans even know how to operate cars anymore?

Yes, there are many drawbacks. This includes the obstacle of getting the technology to do what we want it to do, the bigger obstacle of implementing this large change into society and infrastructure, and risks of fully depending on technology for transportation. However, the pros outweigh the cons. All great technology developments have obstacles in technology and implementation. All dependence on technology has risks. This situation is no different from the developments of cars or airplanes or even cell phones. We stand to risk nothing and win nothing, or reap the benefits of saving lives, reducing traffic, allowing all to have transportation, and more. 

When I think of the future, I imagine everything being automated. This includes automatic transportation, such as use of self-driving cars. Although current technology is a long way away from fully automated transportation, I am confident that we will get there. Flying in planes initially seemed impossible for most of human society, but is now done by millions of people every day. Self-driving cars will one day be the same. Even though there are many drawbacks, such as challenges in technology, implementation, and worst-case scenarios when technology goes wrong or is hacked, the benefits – reduced accidents, saving human lives, less traffic, and better transportation for all – are well worth the risk.

This thereby reduces traffic while still increasing the number of cars that can be on the road. 

A con of self driving cars is that the electric nature of the self-driving cars may reduce the net profit of gasoline industries. This is to say, that in becoming ""new and improved"" manufacturers may stray away from using gas as fuel and move towards using electricity as fuel because this type of fuel is more environmentally friendly. ","There are many advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars but the most important advantage I find is that for self-driving cars it is safer to consistently drive closer together because it is the continuously aware sensor on the car and not the human, who can become easily distracted, that determines how close the car can be to another car. This thereby reduces traffic while still increasing the number of cars that can be on the road.

This is to say, that in becoming ""new and improved"" manufacturers may stray away from using gas as fuel and move towards using electricity as fuel because this type of fuel is more environmentally friendly.

It is the exact theme of being environmentally friendly by being efficient that makes me argue that self-driving cars are beneficial to society. I wish to argue that materials that make the air healthier, make the environment healthier, and then make the people who live in the environment healthier. The example allowing more cars to be on the road would make the air healthier especially if the cars were electric because the reference paper argues that this would reduce traffic and so the cars would be on the road for less time. If the cars on the road for less time, this means that less waste emitted from the energy used. This renders the air healthier and the people in this environment healthier. 
Finally, I wish to argue that the electric nature of the cars would make the environment healthier because gasoline powered cars make the environment less clean. In my experiences abroad I often saw trucks emitting black gas clouds to the point that the vision of the driver behind was impaired. When I visit the gas station, the smell of gasoline is never ignored. I do not mind the smell, but I know it is not healthy to inhale for a long time. Also, the threat of gasoline ignition is not one to ignore. I have a made the mistake a few times of spilling gas on the floor while trying to refuel my vehicle and if there was a fire nearby this could have become more than a ""small, careless""  mistake. All in all when changes can be made for prevention of dangerous incidents and development of diseases, then these changes move society to a healthier life style. 

For the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several advantages to start to develop onto society.",

This is incredibly fascinating to me for it shows how humans have come so far in computer science in order to create such a program that is able to these complicated tasks. One con that I found interesting to include was the idea that lawyers within the personal injury subcategory potentially will have a decreased in cases and, thus, a reduction in their overall income due to the fact that self-driving cars will be able to limit the number of accidents. To me, this con seems to show that the positives outweigh the negatives since, as a society, we should much rather have less accidents - which decreases the amount of harm done to community members - that satisfy personal gains.
","As society progresses, more challenges arise that communities demand to be resolved; however, more solutions are now readily available to combat these problems at a highly superior level never seen before. One huge dilemma that society faces today is how to make driving increasingly efficient and roadways much safer than their current state. Recently, technology has advanced enough to bring about a potential solution: the self-driving car. Although, there is an abundance of evident positives if the self-driving car were to work properly, many are still concerned that this new piece of technology will not solve today's automobile problems with the possibility to bring rise to other issues. Those for self-driving cars associate most of their claims with the fact that the car will create a safer driving environment while those against it seek reason to believe that accidents are not completely eliminated. However, the invention of self-driving cars clearly depicts a widened ability and benefit to each and every community that implements this new technology. The utilization of self-driving cars does not only provide positives that outweigh potential negatives, it also allows society to continue to progress and prosper in an extraordinary way. 
	One huge benefit resulting from the introduction of self-driving cars would be the dramatic improvement on roadways regarding traffic conditions. Through the use of this technology, drivers will feel much safer on the roadways while also having a much more efficient commute. Noticeable improvements that would occur include having reduced commute times and limited traffic incidences. ""According to Eno Transportation, self-driving cars…would significantly improve traffic conditions and congestion. This would help to reduce commute times…also to maximize on gasoline usage…driving time could be reduced by faster speeds allowed on the road"" (""Self-Driving Cars"", par. 18, 22). By increasing the speed limits on roadways, gasoline is used in a further appropriate manner than it is already while, consequently, allowing people to reach their destinations quicker. This, in part, contributes to the reduction of the amount of traffic seen on major highways - something of which is a major factor in automobile accidents. Self-driving cars will also have technology that provides the ability for the car to detect distance between itself and other cars. ""Sensors in the autonomous cars allow vehicles to ride closer together, therefore allowing more cars on the road with actually less traffic"" (par. 28). With this, cars will be able to ride together at a much closer distance, optimizing time and space to decrease traffic problems.
	Although, it appears that self-driving cars are unmistakably beneficial to society, controversy is still held upon the idea of implementing them. A highly observed criticism of self-driving cars would be that car accidents are not completely eliminated on roadways. ""A self-driving car doesn't completely eliminate the likelihood of a car accident…many individuals are nervous about handing over all the power to a computer, which could malfunction and put the danger in a more dangerous situation"" (par. 39, 44). Many uphold their position that using self-driving cars could propose a gigantic threat for those driving for car accidents are still likely, yet the drivers will feel incompetent to handle these types of situations. Yet, what these critics fail to realize is the fact that technology employed in these vehicles has been tested and altered at the sight of the most minute malfunctions. In order to be successful, these companies will not release a device that is not beyond exceptional to the public. Of course, there will be a percentage of problems that will occur, however, this percentage is so small due to there being no possible way to account for these situations - everything proposes the risk of harm, despite its efforts to reduce it. 
	The technology used within these self-driving cars is surpasses current technology today in the sense that it calls for superior behaviors and actions on the road to reduce accidents. Since there are various algorithms within the coding of the car, the vehicle gains the ability to process external information like never before to enhance driving. ""Computers use complicated algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle, and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically"" (par. 13). Through the utilization of such algorithms, it drastically decreases the possibility of accidents to almost nothing for the code is perfected to the point of flawlessness. In direct result of this, traffic problems will not only be reduced but identified in the chance that one does occur. ""In order for the cars to operate most efficiently, they'd need to communicate with one another, helping to identify traffic problems or road risks early on"" (par. 19). Since nothing can be completely eliminated, algorithms will also account for detection and early recognition to minimize the amount of traffic and problems on the road. Through communication between self-driving cars, an individual vehicle will be able to discover potential threats and change route earlier enough - something that current drivers are unable until it is too late. 
	With the implementing of this new and exquisite technology into society, obvious benefits will arise to help improve current road conditions and risks. Even though there appears to have some problems to come out of self-driving cars, the positives clearly outweigh the negatives for driving overall will be safer and more efficient. As a society, members want to ensure that the safety and wellbeing of others not only meets but exceeds standards, and with the use of self-driving cars, communities will flourish beyond anything seen before.

""Pro"" nine states that autonomous cars would especially benefit individuals with disabilities that normally have to rely on public transportation, which can be unreliable and not even truly accommodate them. As a student learning American Sign Language, I have come to realize more about the difficulties that people with disabilities face on a daily basis. However, ""con"" four notes that the security of self-driving cars is questionable due to the computerized intelligence and the potential for hackers. A self-driving car kidnapping someone sounds like the plot of a fun mystery novel.","Not having to worry about paying attention while driving is cool, but dying because your computerized, self-driven car made a mistake is not.

Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan and California are testing cars with artificial intelligence, and they're proving that the hassle creates more danger than the convenience is worth. While it's shown that self-driving cars can prevent accidents caused by human drivers, they don't completely eliminate them and in fact, offer their own set of safety hazards.

According to Auto Insurance Center, ""The very security behind self-driving cars would be a major obstacle, especially because the technology would be of very high interest to
hackers.""

While car accidents account for a large portion of deaths in the United States, adding the unpredictability of self-driving cars' capabilities for safe driving — as well as the possibility for hackers to cause accidents — only make matters more hazardous for everyone on the road.

In addition to this new technology being dangerous for everyone involved, and even those that aren't, it would also be very expensive to implement. All current human-driven vehicles would need to be replaced, which requires workers to scrap the old cars and build new ones. additional training would be necessary for users to understand the self-driving cars and what to do in an emergency.

""While the computer takes over once the vehicle is operational, the driver would still be required to maintain some knowledge about how to operate it safely,"" Auto Insurance Center said.

An important counterpoint for the dangers of autonomous vehicles is that they can significantly help the lives of people with disabilities by providing transportation that is easily accessible. Current public transportation methods, while allowing individuals to not have to drive themselves, still exclude those with certain disabilities and are less convenient.

The same safety problems still apply to individuals with disabilities, of course, and may even affect them more. If an autonomous car were to get in an accident with a disabled passenger, they may not be able to save themselves from the crash or even call to get help.

In general, self-driving cars will be more of a hindrance to society than a help. Not only would they present danger to everyone on the road, they would be too expensive to use world- or even country-wide. Time and energy is better spent improving current human-driven cars as well as creating programs to better educate drivers.",

According to the article, self-driving cars could unburden police officers from their efforts to patrol roadways and handle accidents. This, again according to the article, would allow them to focus their efforts on more serious crimes.

The most interesting ""con"" listing in the article is that regarding the technology's potential effect on employment. The article lists many professions, including taxi drivers and freight transporters, which could be rendered obsolete by vehicles which drive themselves.","Self-driving cars have been praised and vilified in the media and society in general, and with good reason. The potential benefits of such a technology are enormous, both when measured in dollars and in human lives. The drawbacks, while mostly speculative, are equally serious. Criticisms come due to a reasonable fear of the unknown. How will self-driving cars operate in unfamiliar conditions? Can we rely on today's GPS systems to provide accurate information to our robotic vehicles? What happens during a malfunction, and will our cars be safe from hackers? All of these questions are reasonable and may even justify a slow-down or regulation of the autonomy vehicle industry. However, I think it's important for us to remember that, no matter what we think, the discussion is not if, but when, robotic cars will enter the mainstream. The future can be delayed, not prevented, and at the end of the day, why would we want to prevent it anyway?

Self-driving cars are just part of a long tradition of disruptive technologies that caused concerns in their times, from the printing press to the industrial revolution. Even within the same industry, there were those who fought the introduction of cars to roadways. It is a little known fact that early road advocates were bicyclists, not drivers. Roads of the early-20th and late-19th century were populated by pedestrians and cyclists, despite the first motor vehicle being produced for public consumption as early as 1886. When motor vehicles became more widely available, there were those who said they would never catch on. Eventually, after they HAD caught on, there were those who claimed they would be too dangerous to have near those walking on foot or riding a bicycle. Now, especially in American culture, it would be hard to imagine a world in which cars didn't dominate roadways. Once again, I make no assertion as to whether the change was good or bad, but instead that it was inevitable. And, just as motor vehicles were the wave of the future then, autonomous vehicles are the wave of the future now.

It is true that there will be fatalities related to autonomous vehicles, just as it is true that there were (and are) fatalities related to traditional motor vehicles. It is true that there will be hackings related to autonomous vehicle security, just as there are hackings related to the modern financial system. It is true that many people will lose their jobs because of autonomous vehicles, just as it is true that modern agricultural practices reduced the percentage of farms in the American workforce from more than 50% in 1860 to as little as 1% today, all while the number of people fed has increased exponentially. So once again, the question is not if, but when. While criticisms of self-driving cars are important, those efforts should never focus on stopping this emergent technology, but instead helping us to prepare for the inevitable.",

The common saying “time is money” is true in some cases, and relieving the duty of driving on your commute provides additional time that was previously unavailable. Time is a gift, and having time to reflect, read, catch up with loved ones, or whatever needs to be done is an amazing pro. You no longer have to actively participate in an otherwise stressful or treacherous commute. I think its fascinating people may have time to eat breakfast, get dressed in the car, or even watch TV without risking an accident. 

Con: Self- driving cars en masse are unprecedented and therefore no legal cases regarding strictly automated car accident exist. Even if a majority of people bought into the concept of self-driving cars, accidents would still occur.  What if a self driving car hits a pedestrian, or self-driving car hits another one, or finally if a self-driving car hit a car driven by a human? It is difficult to decide where to place the blame. It could be a slew of things ranging from human error/ indifference, car manufacturing, traffic signal malfunction,  or even the software developer. I think it would be interesting to create a precedent and see what the future would be like in this case. 
","The discussion of the effects of self-driving cars on society may seem in the distant future, but the future is now. Self-driving cars are gaining popularity with Google and other manufacturing and software companies. As with any new technology, there are certainly reservations on the impact it would have on society as well as the positive effects. The advantages of implementing self-driving cars en masse far outweigh the potential problems associated with them. The time has come to embrace the future with open arms, and it starts with self-driving cars.
	Some common concerns with self-driving cars arise from trusting and depending on machines. If humans never have to drive again, then they would forget how to, and this would be deleterious in times of crisis or emergency. Alongside this, people fear a malfunction in software, which may lead to accidents with other cars- human, or self-driving. Another gripe with software is the immense capabilities it would have and how much personal information and data it might store. This then leads to distrust in data management and in some cases theft of this data. Humans tend to have an innate distrust of machines, and putting their lives on the line to be driven around is no exception.
	Although the aforementioned concerns with self-driving cars are valid, it should not get in the way of the progress of these incredible inventions. There are so many advantages in self-driving cars, but the biggest one may be as simple as time. Self-driving cars would be completely automated and have the potential to link up with other cars on the road and create an almost perfect traffic system where tailgating is safe, high speed travel, and pedestrian detection. Buying in to this system lets society run better, safer and quicker. In this scenario, commute times would be cut, city driving would be made easier since the car could drop one off and then find its own parking, and could save the user so much time. As if all of these reasons weren’t enough, one would have time on the commute to catch up with loved ones, safely eat, read, watch TV, and even sleep! Time is precious, and not having to divert precious attention and time to the road allows unprecedented time to the user. While people may still disagree that these are not enough to change their minds I claim that this technology may be the quicker and safer alternative to public transportation. If these people trust airplanes, trains, subways, and even motorized scooters, then they should not have a problem with self-driving cars. The future is here and this is it. Moral dilemmas and technical issues can be improved on and studied, but the precedent must exist. Let’s give self-driving cars a shot.

This was in comparison to humans and how they can always be distracted while driving and thus cause so many of the car accidents in the US. Humans can be distracted while driving from using their phones, the radio, eating, talking to passengers, or simply looking out their window. However, the computers that would control the self-driving cars would not have any of these problems and would surely prevent many of the car accidents caused by distracted driving. 

The ""con"" argument I found most interesting was #2 when it stated that average total cost to own and thus operate a self-driving car would be upwards of $100,000. This high price would definitely deter low and middle income individuals from purchasing the self-driving cars and the only way I see self-driving cars being successful in the future is if the whole population collectively utilizes them on the road. ","The overall advantages of self-driving cars, when implemented without any setbacks, are that they can be safer, cheaper, and more time saving when compared to the standard way of humans manual driving cars. Self-driving cars would be safer because they would eliminate the human element of distracted driving, caused by talking on the cell phone or falling asleep at the wheel. They would also be safer because they would decrease car accidents by being programmed to stop at a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid serious collisions. In addition, self-driving cars would be cheaper because it would save money from all the accidents it would have prevented. As the article mentioned, the US Department of Transportation values every human life at $9.2 million and self-driving cars would prevent many of the high insurance and healthcare costs that develop because of car accidents. Self-driving cars would also be cheaper for the government by saving money that would have been spent on transit projects such as building trains. Lastly, self-driving cars would be time saving for both passengers and police officers. Passengers who would now be allowed to rest or perform work on their commute to their destination, and police officers would be able to spend less time catching speeding vehicles on the highway and more time solving more serious crimes. 

Some disadvantages of self-driving cars are cost for creating these vehicles and complex technology/ security required to prevent serious malfunctions and hacks. For instance, it was estimated the cost for a self-driving car was upwards of $100,000, making it a luxury item that only the upper class and rich would be able to afford. If only a smaller percentage of the population utilize self-driving cars then a majority of car accidents caused by distracted driving would still occur and no money would be saved at all. In addition, like with any technology created this 21st century there are risks for serious and even fatal malfunctions. Although not common, everyday electronics such as iPhones and laptops, concepts deemed impossible a century ago, do in fact experience problems and have stopped working for its users. While iPhones and laptops are nowhere as complex as self-driving cars, the fact of the matter is the electronic advancements made these past decades have been remarkable, but if these items have showed us anything it is that nothing is ever perfect and some software or hardware problem could always occur at any moment and without notice. It would be difficult to program self-driving cars to distinguish between new traffic laws or recent road work that occurred overnight. Also, it would be dangerous if hackers would be able to hijack vehicles and purposely take control of these self-driving vehicles. 

Overall, self-driving cars would be a huge benefit for society. The main factor that would deem self-driving cars an advantage rather than a disadvantage for our society would be the aspect of decreasing distracted driving which would thus decrease car accidents and save lives. In a world where technological advancements are created for the betterment of our society, what better reason to use self-driving cars if they can save lives. A human life is the only thing on earth that can't be bought no matter how much money an individual has. Death does not discriminate based on age, gender, sex, religion, race, or social status. Car accidents do occur and are too common in our society with the CDC reporting an average of 33,000 fatalities occurring from car accidents yearly. While most of those car accents are caused by distracted driving, self-driving cars would eliminate that problem entirely because the computers controlling the vehicles would have no way of experiencing the same distractions as humans. Yes, the cost of creating the complex technology for self-driving cars and then selling them to individuals may seem high at first, but as new technology is constantly updated and manufactured, self-driving cars can one day be affordable for everyone. Society needs to at least try to utilize self-driving cars to prevent unnecessary deaths because although it may take years before more individuals can be able to afford the self-driving vehicle, it will all be worth it if you just imagine being able to spend a little more time with someone you lost due to a car accident.

One pro that was the most interesting was the possibility of having more cars actually on the road because self-driving cars allow such vehicles to ride closer together. I thought this was interesting because it seems almost ridiculous to imagine; a road jam-packed with cars so close to each other seems likely to lead to an accident. One con that I found most interesting was the ambiguity concerning how self-driving cars would maneuver through certain obstacles, or how they would function under local driving laws. One example cited was the possible difficulty in identifying the legality of turning right on red, as this differs between states. ","Behind our evolving society is the driving force of technology, enabling us to do things in our daily lives more quickly and efficiently, saving us time that we consider precious and not to be wasted. When we apply technology to our everyday lives, there are a number of issues that can possibly arise. This can be seen very clearly in the topic of self-driving cars. While there are several eye-catching benefits, such as the possibility of decreased accidents and shortened driving time, there are also a number of drawbacks. These drawbacks include glaringly large expenses, the possibility of technology failure, and concerns regarding the elimination of transportation jobs, like taxi drivers. Unless, these problems and questions regarding self-driving cars are resolved, self-driving cars stand as dangerous and overly-ambitious ideas that should not be allowed on the road. 
Self-driving cars flaunt how beneficial they can be to society because they can cut down waste and driving time, ultimately saving money in the long-run. Road congestion can be cut down because of the detailed algorithms of these cars that allow them to do things such as determining distances from objects other vehicles. While the computers within the car are so complex that they can do such things on their own, this does not allow them to be able to identify things a human could, like if there were a police officer directing traffic. Another stated benefit of self-driving cars is that they will decrease the number of car accidents, due to a human driver's unstable state of mind or poor choices. Such situations are seen with drivers who are under the influence, or those who are older and have duller senses and reaction times. However, there are still the possibilities of accidents occurring with these cars. The likelihood of a car accident is not zero, despite how hi-tech and accurate these cars are. For one, drivers who are in an unstable state of mind may not be able to take control of their car in the case that the self-driving technology of the car fails or malfunctions. In addition, under certain weather conditions, the car's level of safety is compromised. For example, the sensor atop the car's roof can be damaged by heavy rain. This leads to a bigger question: what will happen once the self-driving technology of the car fails? The role that the human driver has when put together with a self-driving car is ambiguous. The self-driving car is indeed a piece of autonomous technology that strips some control from its human drivers. 
Often people are so easily infatuated with the bright shiny pieces of technology that emerge onto the mainstream, whether it be the newest smartphone or pair of headphones. With self-driving cars, it is important to not be swept up in the wild dreams and goals for these machines. While their potential is certainly something to explore and inspect, the implementation of these cars is too early and would not beneficial too society, as there are too many issues that require much time and effort to thoroughly resolve.

Since there would supposedly be fewer accidents, car insurance and healthcare costs would have decreased significantly. I chose this pro because it also included the value that the U.S. Department of Transportation assigned to each person: $9.2 million. I questioned what factors in each person’s life contributed to this value. Was it strictly healthcare and life necessities? Or did it include luxuries such as vacations and entertainment? A con of self-driving cars was the failure of technology and the resulting interaction with humans if that were to happen. If the technology of self-driving cars were to fail, there’s a possibility that it cannot interact with human signals which would cause a disturbance on the road. I chose this con because it added another unknown factor into the equation. There are too many questions about the security and reliability of the technology. ","As technology slowly begins to overtake human development and the economy starts to grow, the need for efficiency is inevitable. With this desire in mind, investors and developers are targeting everyday actions in hopes of eliminating menial tasks. This can be seen with the invention of robot vacuums and dishwashers in the past. Nowadays, these developers are focusing their attention onto cars. With cars being one of the most common modes of transportation in the United States, people use them nearly every day. With the introduction of self-driving cars, the time spent driving everyday can be used for productive tasks.  The tasks that would once be a distraction to the driver would become their primary focus as the car handles all of the driving. However, with the evolution of technology, the potential dangers increase. Though self-driving cars would make society more efficient, they should not be allowed due to confounding factors which could make society more dangerous and susceptible to terrorist attacks.
With the prominence of technology comes the rise of those who know how technology works. The integration of self-driving cars would make society vulnerable to threats such as hackers. These hackers would wreak massive havoc upon the roads if they are able to gain access to the system. Along with being able to control the cars, the hackers would be able to access the personal information of car owners. This adds onto the preexisting list of risks associated with driving. Even though self-driving cars are able to communicate with other cars, they do not completely eliminate the chances of a car accident occurring. In the case of accidents, it is difficult to shift the blame onto a single party. Not only is there still a chance of injury but there is also a chance of fraud and thievery. Though technology is meant to make life efficient and easier, self-driving cars only adds danger and confusion. 
Technology is not perfect and can be delicate. There is always a chance for malfunctions and unexpected problem with the software. In the case of inclement weather, there is a chance that the sensors on the cars could glitch and provide problems for the passengers. This creates even more danger for the passengers. The integration of self-driving cars would force passengers to put their lives in the hands of a computer software instead of their own. Though self-driving cars could make society more efficient, there are too many unknown factors within this world.

This is possible through the computers that are equipped on the cars. I found this interesting because of the amount of time people would save and be more productive. Ultimately, the average human can live their life more efficiently. A con I found interesting was how the self driving car revolution would create a huge population of unemployment in the transportation sector. This is intriguing because unemployment seems to be a deal breaker for people in this current debate.","The idea of having self driving cars may have seemed far away into the future until now. Or is it. The initial reaction would be to love the new, innovative idea. However, every time technology introduces a revolutionary invention, it is always met with various critical drawbacks. If possible, self-driving cars could lower car accidents and drunk driving with the use of computer algorithms, reduce traffic, and create higher speed limits through computer operations. But, this would have worse results. In this recent debate, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages because of the potential risks in the future. 

First, the creation of self driving cars would cause unemployment in the transportation sector. Not only will taxi drivers, bus drivers, car instructors, workers, and personal injury lawyers lose their jobs, but also the gasoline industry and auto manufacturers. America cannot afford to risk losing two of the biggest industries that create large amounts of revenue. On top of that, self driving cars would be not be consumer friendly. The average American citizen would not be able to purchase one of these cars because of the high cost. The engineering, software, sensors, and power/computer requirements itself costs $100,000. However, proponents of the new innovation still say that the solution to cities that have inadequate public transportation is self driving cars. This is a clear misconception because public transportation would cease to exist and people would not be able to afford the new cars. Ultimately, the adoption of self driving cars is a bad choice that will negatively affect the workers and economy. 

Another huge risk is security and safety. Implementing computers in cars would bring all the vulnerabilities of the computer with it. Because extensive amounts of information must be stored in the computers for the car to operate, issues regarding identity theft is unavoidable. Personal data in the software such as bank account information could be stolen by hackers. This issue also brings up a safety hazard because self driving cars are only suited for the perfect scenario and deemed to technological failures. In bad weather situations such as heavy rain and snow, laser sensors will fail. In addition, self driving cars would have a hard time driving through hazards, detours, accidents, and on roads of different areas because of the road laws in each state. Although the use of GPS maps have aided a lot of drivers today, there are times where the directions are inaccurate. Since self driving cars rely on the GPS, there is a possibility in which cars could take dangerous turns off the road. 

In a perfect society, self driving cars can definitely exist. In our world today, America is far from it. Only if there are no flaws and testings come out perfect, will there be a serious discussion of overhauling the automobile industry. But, it seems foolish to implement this now. Promise and opportunity is not enough to fully adopt self driving cars.

On the other hand, an interesting downside of self-driving cars is the idea that, if not widely used, self-driving cars do not offer their maximum potential in preventing accidents and saving time and cost. I find these ideas interesting because the main benefits of self-driving cars depend on their proliferation throughout the country, which is unlikely to happen soon. Is the period before widespread use worthwhile if self-driving cars do not offer immediate, promising results?","Far too often, the media presents heart-wrenching stories of innocent people killed in car accidents from drunk drivers or distracted drivers. Who would argue against a solution to these preventable problems derived from careless human mistakes? One proposed yet controversial solution is implementing self-driving cars. While many benefits exist, I still do not support their use in society. The benefits of self-driving cars are easily understood: they greatly reduce human error, which is the result of 81% of car accidents. Minor accidents like rear-endings would decrease because the computers of the cars would use algorithms to calculate appropriate stopping distances. As The New York Times suggests, self-driving cars would greatly help elderly and disabled people travel. The stress of parking would decrease as self-driving cars dropped people off near their destination. Self-driving cars would also reduce traffic congestion by electronically communicating in a process called “platooning” and enable more people to be on the road at once. Speed limits could even increase as computers in the car can manage safe driving at higher speeds than humans. However, many cons accompany these potential benefits. To begin, self-driving costs currently have a huge price tag of over $100,000, thereby diminishing the number of Americans able to buy one. Also, if self-driving cars do not become extremely widespread, they would not offer their maximum potential in preventing accidents and saving time and cost because they could not platoon together. Inclement weather impairs the sensor abilities of self-driving cars, putting people on the road during a storm at risk. People both riding in self-driving cars and on the road with self-driving cars experience increased anxiety at the idea of self-driving cars malfunctioning.  On a broader scale, ethical concerns would arise during a car accident with a human and self-driving car, leaving ambiguous blame toward the car itself and the car company. Many people could lose jobs who work in human operated car companies or the gasoline industry. Self-driving cars relying on sensors, GPS devices, and traffic signals would suffer if these other technology sources failed. I believe that America would not fully gain all of the benefits of self-driving cars unless more existed than human drivers, which is unlikely to happen quickly due to high cost and personal hesitations. The downsides of self-driving cars would continue to occur while people received little benefits. While self-driving cars offer an efficient solution, they would be too hard to incorporate into modern society. The transition phase of slowly adding self-driving cars would cause tension and last until production costs are reduced. At this time, since the perks do not outweigh the cons, perhaps America is not ready for self-driving cars until we can implement them efficiently to truly reap their benefits.",

The percent that they gave of human caused accidents is staggering, which is why I found this one so amazing since this technology gets rid of most of that number.
Number four on the con side says that with the advent of self driving cars adds the danger of them being hacked. This could make it easier for people to commit crimes, which I found fairly interesting.","With the advent of self driving car technology, as with any new invention, people debate its positives and its negatives. They can make the roads safer, make traffic less congestive, save people time, free up police, and have a multitude of other benefits, but at the same time they can be susceptible to hacking, put some out of work, and aren't always perfect. In my personal opinion however, I believe self driving cars are an overall positive invention, and that most of the cons that are prevalent are growing pains that any new technology has and will be solved fairly soon.
Most accidents are caused by human error, around 81 percent to be exact. With their being around 33,000 fatalities on the road every year, that's about 27,000 lives being saved every year, as self driving technology basically ends error on the part of the driver. Most accidents occur due to distracted or impaired driving, which is impossible for a computer as they can not take their eyes of the road and, thankfully, can not get drunk. Another positive is that the decrease in overall accidents on the road give police more time to focus on other situations. They also do not have to constantly be giving tickets as cars can drop off their passengers and park themselves wherever is convenient, and come back whenever they need picked up again. Also with the people in the vehicle not having to do anything, they have more time to work on other things. The cars also work together and relay traffic information, which decreases traffic and allows them to get to their location faster, which also adds to the passengers time. All this time saved can lead to a even more productive society where everyone can do more and can get anywhere promptly without having to worry about traffic.
As with all new inventions, skeptics have come about spouting the negatives of the self driving car technology, but most of it can be solved with more testing and more support. They say that self driving cars can be hacked and that they are not as effective in violent weather, but these are just the problems with new technology. These problems will be accounted for and worked on over time, eventually becoming less and less of an issue. Another problem people bring up is cost, as it is expensive for someone to buy one as of today. As time goes on, the cost would go down as with any new product due to advancements and scaling of the industry, but even if it was still to expensive for people, since the cars can drive and park themselves, there could be the advent of an Uber or Lyft type service where individuals can have these cars pick them up and take them wherever they need to go, which could eliminate even the need to own a car. A final point they bring up is that it will hurt many industries, such as the gasoline and driving instructor industry. With this point I ask, should we not have invented cars as to keep horseshoe makers in business? Of course not, as we should not halt progress and overall good for the many rather than just focusing on the needs of a select few individuals.
Overall, self driving cars should be considered an positive step for the advancement of society. Most of the problems with them will be solved over time, and the pros for the implementation of it are staggering. I think they will be implemented soon, and I can't wait for them to arrive.",

The concern of heavy rain damaging the sensor and impairing the car's ability to function as intended calls into the question the safety of the technology and if the self-driving technology is able to overcome barriers such as these.","
Today's world is punctuated by new innovations and technologies being released every day. An intriguing one that is generating equal interest and consternation across the United States is the technology of self-driving cars. Supporters of self-driving cars note that it would improve fuel efficiency and drive down gasoline costs to consumers, that it would dramatically reduce car-related morbidity and mortality, and that it would allow disabled and elderly individuals independence and the ability to travel freely unlike they could before. However on the opposite side of things, self-driving cars pose new risks and concerns as well. Concerns about them include their inability to operate in adverse weather conditions, their inability to handle unique road conditions and human traffic signals when mechanical traffic signals aren't present, the high cost associated with the vehicles, and the general wariness that many consumers have for self-driving cars and if the technology would ever even be widely accepted enough for use.

Personally, I find the benefits to self-driving cars vastly outweigh the negative factors. Self-driving cars provide a safe, efficient platform that can reduce motor vehicle accident associated fatalities and injuries significantly, reduce the time of commutes and the cost associated with extended periods of driving, and allows people who aren't able to drive such as the disabled and elderly a newfound freedom that so many who have access to cars take for granted. The cost of human life that can be saved is alone the best supporting reason for self driving cars. It has been reported that up to 81% of motor vehicle accidents are due to human error, and this could be completely mitigated by computers who don't have the capability to be distracted, tired, drunk, or any other factor that reduces a human's ability to drive safely. By taking the human factor out of driving, countless lives and debilitating injuries can be prevented with self-driving cars. Additionally, self-driving cars have the potential to revolutionize traffic patterns via their ability to ""platoon"" where they drive in coordinated packs together. This coordination allows more cars to be on the road as they can drive closer together in a safer manner than humans ever could, It also removes the human inefficiency of driving that causes traffic jams and congestion and would therefore reduce commute times and optimize fuel efficiency to save consumers more money on gasoline. And lastly comes the ability of self-cars to substantially improve the lives of society's least mobile individuals such as the elderly and disabled by granting them newfound independence. Many of us who can walk, drive, and see, etc normally take for granted our ability to move and don't realize how dramatically self-driving cars can improve their lives. No longer would they have to wait for public access transit vans that are known for being slow and extremely limited in hours and range.

Of course however, there are negative factors to self-driving cars that are valid and warrant important consideration as well. Opponents to self-driving cars note that the technology just isn't ready yet, self-driving cars still can't handle poor weather conditions such as heavy rain, they cannot accommodate for human traffic signals when regular traffic signals fail, and that there is still a general opposition to the idea of drivers relinquishing control of their cars to a computer which could potentially put them in dangerous situations. However, many of these concerns can be remedied with time and further development. As the technology matures and barriers are hurdled, these risks will be mitigated and self-driving cars can progressively become widely accepted.",

One of the leading causes of car accidents in the United States is the driver being distracted by another task. I found this interesting because with self-driving vehicles, distractions will be limited, as the driver will not have to worry about driving and focusing on another task at the same time. However, one con of using self-driving vehicles that I found most interesting is that it would not completely eliminate car accidents. There are not enough tests that show self-driving vehicles eliminating the amount of car accidents, and if there happens to be a car accident with a self-driving vehicle, it would be hard to determine whether the driver or the vehicle itself is to blame. I found this very interesting because I've read many articles that promote the use of self-driving vehicles, but I did not realize that there is not enough substantial evidence to support the idea that these vehicles are safe. ","Car accidents have been a major problem in the United States for decades. Centers for Disease Control states that fatalities from traffic incidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people. In previous years, many researchers are discovering possible solutions on the issue of car accidents in the United States. One solution that is becoming very popular right now is the idea of self-driving vehicles. To many people, this seems like a great solution to eliminate car accidents, but others, like myself, are more skeptical about this idea. 

Self-driving cars may seem like a probable solution to eliminate car accidents, although there haven’t been enough tests to determine whether self-driving vehicles are truly safe and helpful with the issue. Because distraction is one of the leading causes of car accidents in America, self-driving vehicles will definitely be useful as there aren’t many opportunities for distraction.  Another good reason why self-driving vehicles could help the issue is that it can decrease drunk driving incidents, which can save many people’s lives. 

While there are many good reasons to have more self-driving vehicles, some believe that having these vehicles are not sufficient for our environment, especially because the cost of making these vehicles are very high. Another reason why it may not be a good idea to have self-driving vehicles is because they could eliminate many jobs in the transportation industry, and the gasoline industry will likely suffer as well. 

If more self-driving cars are prevalent, this could mean that many of us will rely more on this technology, which could lead to the inability of operating any motor vehicles. This can be very dangerous on the road because if the car were to have any type of malfunction and the driver has limited knowledge on how to operate a vehicle, this could lead to an accident.

There are many solutions to eliminate car accidents, and in my opinion, a self-driving vehicle is not one of them. It is not wise to put so much money into something that does not guarantee safety for our environment. Having these types of vehicles is also not worth taking away people’s jobs. It is also not worth putting risking people’s lives, especially for those who live in areas that snow or rain very frequently, because these computer-based cars are incapable of operating at a high level of safety in certain weather conditions. Having a self-driving vehicle may seem like a good idea for right now, but if we do see more of these cars in the future, we need to consider how this advanced technology will interact with human drivers and the wider driving environment.

Traffic security is guaranteed even if the drivers are distracted, which is a common situation. Also, human drivers are not very reliable compared to the accurate self-driving algorithm. The safety brought by self-driving cars can lessen the amount of money spent in public health and insurance. Robots can communicate with each other and carefully calculate the best route to reach destination and save time and gasoline. Finally, elder citizens and the disabled can drive with the help of self-driving car.
cons:
It requires certain knowledge to use self-driving car. The new technology is costly. There are many uncertainties on the road, it is questionable whether self-driving car can handle these, especially when there are many human drivers on the road as well. Additionally, it hinders the work of human police.","3. am in the morning after drinking with your best friends at junior high, you are exhausted, lost, and drunk in the middle of nowhere. You want to drive back home but that is just too dangerous. A self-driving car can take you home safely. This is a rather new area and quite debatable. How can we make sure that robots will solve all the complicated situation on the roads? What if there are other humans involved, such as other drivers or police giving signals? Most importantly, how can we use it? Indeed, there are many uncertainties related to self-driving cars but overall it is a promising topic. Self-driving cars can avoid distractions, help elder and disabled people to drive car and save energy and time.

First of all, let us address the doubt of the self-driving algorithm. Even though the situation on the road is unpredictable, many situations can be highly generalized. For example, if the sensor noticed something in the front, regardless of whether it is a furry cat or grumpy grandpa, it will stop at once. The same principal applies to other human drivers around. Moreover, learning to drive itself is difficult for many people. Learning how to tell a robot to drive should not be harder than that.

Human drivers can be easily distracted. “Many of [traffic] accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving.” However, it is much harder to get a computer lost in the beautiful view along the road. In this case, AI is much more accurate than human. Human drivers maybe drunk or affected by drugs. They may also be affected by their mood, from depression to ecstasy. They may also busy with talking to their passengers. If Al is in charge, human can spend less time in driving and more time in focusing their own career, which is beneficial for them as well.

Additionally, many people rely heavily on public transportation or other people in their family in order to travel. This is because they cannot drive on their own due to physical limitation. However, not everyone has time to pick them up. Especially when we are entering the era that more and more elder people are around. I was forced to wait for my grandmother and drive her to her home in the childhood. This not only spend much time of mine which I could have spent in other places, but also my grandmother can only travel once every week because my father is too busy to drive her one more time. Just imagine how much benefit self-driving car will bring to us. 

Moreover, AI can calculate the best route. In our class, we learn about minimal spending tree and many other algorithms to find the shortest route. However, not many people will apply graph theory before they drive. Therefore, using a self-driver can make sure that they find the best possible way to go to school or company. This will save the amount of time they spend on the road and save gasoline as well. This will protect our environment too.

Whether they are distracted due to their environment (other passengers, looking for something in the car), their emotions (road rage, anxiety), or their physiology (tired, under the influence of alcohol, drugs), they are not putting the amount of attention into driving that a self driving car could do. 

There is a security risk when it comes to having a car that is driven using software and sensors as opposed to hands on the steering wheel and feet on the gas and brake. In the case of the former, it opens up the possibility that someone could hack into the technology and cause a malfunction possibly leading to an accident. ","Trey Anastasio once said ""things don't go on forever, and the quicker you accept that change is inevitable, the happier you're going to be"". Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, life has changed dramatically: horse and buggies to cars, radio to television, telegraph to computers that fit in your pocket. As technology has developed over time, we have integrated it more and more in our daily lives, and that technology has in-turn brought ease, entertainment, and safety. Handing over the semblance of control one has while driving to a car which would drive itself can bring about trepidation, but when accounting for the increase in both safety and time, it can begin to look like the exceptional revolution that it is.   

Humans are prone to error in everything that they do--and driving is no exception. Eighty-one percent of motor vehicle accidents today are a result of human error. Whether they are distracted due to their environment (other passengers in the car, looking for something, a large number of cars on the road), their emotions (road rage, anxiety), or their physiology (tired, under the influence of alcohol/drugs), they are not putting the amount of attention into driving that a self driving car could do. Allowing the well tested software to do the driving increases the safety of the roads. If there are safer roads, police would be able to shift their attention from speeding tickets to larger issues, like crime and neighborhood safety. Whether on the road or off, self driving cars allow for an increase in safety. 

According to Newsroom, the average American spends 17,600 minutes a year behind the wheel. When converted into hours, then days that number equates to a little over 12 days each year. Now imagine being able to reclaim that time, being able to take the attention that you used to to operate your vehicle and give it to something more meaningful. This could be reading the newspaper or a new book, talking to friends or family, eating a meal that maybe you missed, anything you could do sitting on your couch at home.  As the quantity of self driving cars on the road increases, so does the safety of highways and roads that typically become congested at peak driving times. This increase in safety could eventually lead to increased speed limits, decreasing the time spent commuting to and from work. Self driving cars give you your time back.

There are arguments against the implementation of self driving cars which are concerned with the reduction of business for the gas industry and personal injury lawyers. And yes those are people's jobs, but the success of those vocations is contingent upon destruction--whether that be a person becoming injured or the planet succumbing to global warming and pollution. While self driving cars could increase the safety and fuel efficiency of cars, working to reduce destruction.  

Self driving cars are a large change for the average person, but change is not always unfavorable. The widespread implementation of self driving cars would bring safety on and off the road, as well as decrease the amount of and increase the quality of time you spend in your vehicle. ",

Currently, speed limits are regulated in consideration of human errors. A highly specialized machine that can only focus on the happenings on the road allows for a higher speed. This is interesting because it shows the potential for highly efficient systems, due to a lack of human intervention. However, legal issues may become more complicated. Although humans are taken out of the blame for accidents, it will be difficult to pinpoint who is responsible for the malfunction because of numerous companies involved in the creation. It is interesting that although our society is aiming towards simplification, sometimes the result can be more complicated than before.
","Do you remember childhood car rides spent gazing out the window, reading, and sleeping? Those are always thought of as the good old days, but they can become a reality once again. Self-driving cars are the next creation for the future. Pioneered by Google, self driving cars allow for a safer and more enjoyable transportation experience. However, there are numerous areas for potential problems that could make them less efficient and ultimately more dangerous. Through the benefits and drawbacks, it is clear that self-driving cars will not benefit society as much as they are projected to.

Distraction, multitasking, under influence, texting. These are all situations that drivers may experience, situations that society has come to fear due to the massive amount of accidents caused by them. A machine that is highly specialized to focus on just the road and surrounding vehicles, would certainly take the human error out of driving. A computerized car is unable to get distracted, and thus will significantly reduce the potential for common accidents. Also, there is the potential that travel times could be reduced. A car set on one task, will achieve its goal faster than one that is under the control of a human. Even more, there are beneficial long term opportunities for society. Currently, a large part of the police force is tasked with regulating drivers and giving tickets to those who don’t comply. However, because the amount of irrational driving and human error will be reduced, there will no longer be a need for the police to govern the roads. As a result, their skills can be better used to combat crime areas and sources of corruption that need attention. The benefits of self driving cars are both short and long term, and will help create a better and safer environment for others. 
 
While there is the potential for many positive outcomes in relation to self driving cars, there are also many drawbacks. Some problems associated with driving the cars is that because the technology and effort placed into creating them is so intensive, they are extremely expensive and thus the majority of the public would not be able to afford them. Also, in today’s society hacking and hackers are very prevalent. The prospect of hackers gaining access to the systems of self-driving cars can make driving extremely dangerous, potentially introducing another potential strategy of attack for terrorists and criminals. Even more, self-driving cars may not be advanced enough to replace the knowledge of human mind. Recognizing numerous street signs and driving under different weather conditions is something that a self driving car may be lacking the technology to perceive. 

The positive aspects of self driving cars are compelling, however, it is evident that until there are even further advances in technology, the cars are unfit for the road. While it is said to take the human error out of driving, self-driving cars cannot emulate the human understanding of the rules and regulations of the road in different areas and conditions. The idea of travel time being reduced seems beneficial, however given the price of the cars, it is unlikely that there will be enough without human control to be able implement these new possibilities. Another seemingly positive aspect of self-driving cars would be that they eliminate the need for a police force. However, when self-driving cars malfunction, the legal issues will become more complicated. Making one of the cars requires the effort of many companies and individuals, so if a problem occurs it will hard to trace it back to the cause. 

 
To go back to the good old days of enjoying car rides and not thinking about the dangers of the road would be very satisfying. However, placing hope in a machine to keep us safe and free of problems is not something that can be considered currently. Self driving cars have the potential to be very efficient and safe, however they also bring many potential problems along with them, overall not making them something beneficial to society.

Without having to focus the majority of their attention on driving, drivers would be able to use that time to do other important things. This could potentially mean that commuting time would be less important to people, allowing them to live further away from their place of work and changing the demographic landscape of cities. A con I found interesting was the one about how self-driving cars may be susceptible to hacking, as are all other technologies of this nature. I hadn't thought of this possibility, and I think this would deter a lot of people from using a self-driving car.","As with many technologies associated with automation, there are both costs and advantages to self-driving cars. In theory they would create a safer, more cost-effective driving experience and would eliminate many of the tragic accidents that contribute to one of the leading causes of death in modern society. While these benefits come at many costs, some of which we cannot even predict, I believe self-driving cars would be overall beneficial to society. 

It would be naive to think that self-driving cars wouldn't cause any car accidents. There would still be risks of malfunction due to glitches, bad weather, or not being able to take into account human traffic signals, but these risks would come nowhere near the risks associated with humans driving cars. In fact, according to the article, 81 percent of car accidents are attributable to human error. Taking human error out of the equation would dramatically reduce the amount of deaths and injuries that result from car crashes and that shatter families, schools and entire communities. 

The cost-effectiveness of self-driving cars goes beyond just saving money from insurance and healthcare costs. By reducing traffic, money could be saved on gas. By reducing the need for police officers to be patrolling the roads, these resources could be allocated elsewhere. And, finally, without having to focus the majority of their attention on driving, drivers would be able to use that time to do other important things.

Self-driving cars would make transportation more accessible for everyone. Disabled individuals, the elderly, as well as people in communities with little access to other forms of public transportation would benefit. Further, self-driving cars would act as designated drivers for people who are intoxicated, eliminating the issue of drunk driving. 

Though self-driving cars could put people who work in the transportation sector out of work, this would be a gradual process that would go hand in hand with new employment or training opportunities for those employees, many of whom only work in this sector part-time. Further, this kind of argument is also used in matters of climate change by people who believe that the jobs of those currently in the coal and natural gas industries are more important than the dire need to switch to renewable energy sources in order to curb climate change. We have to ask ourselves whether the employment of people in the transportation sector and the fallout they would experience in a world with self-driving cars is more important than the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives a year.

This point explains how self-driving cars would enable those who have disabilities to regain some autonomy as they would not need to rely as heavily on outside help for transportation. I found this interesting because it manages to humanize the topic of self-driving cars, and it does so with a reputable source – the New York Times. The “cons” side also made several decent points, but, again, number nine interested me the most. This argument brings into question how cars would be able to interpret traffic directions from humans if a traffic-directing device were to fail. Technology work wonderfully – until it doesn’t work.","Self-driving cars might still sound like something from a sci-fi story, but these automobiles are finding their way onto the road more and more. Companies such as Google are constantly testing out new self-driving technologies in an effort to decrease human error on the road and increase transportation efficiency. As with every technological advancement, though, the implementation of this research brings into question both the possible advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.

According to the article “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” from the Auto Insurance Center, there are a plethora of arguable points from both sides of the spectrum. The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. 

While I understand why so many are hesitant to commit entirely to a world where cars “think” for themselves, the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. At its basic level of interpretation, self-driving cars represent exactly what technology strives for, and that is innovation. Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.

Self-driving cars also have the potential to save lives. They rectify the lingering issue of drunk or drug-influenced drivers who should not be operating normal motor vehicles. These advanced cars would also decrease distracted drivers or tired drivers on the road. This article cites the CDC and points out that “fatalities from traffic accidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people.” All of the impaired drivers mentioned previously contribute to this statistic. But when unsafe drivers are taken out of the driver’s seat, the overall safety of people everywhere increases.

While there will always be the “what ifs” of self-driving cars, we can’t let that stop us from innovating. With self-driving cars, commuters and pedestrians gain an increased sense of security and well-being.",

Distracted driving is the leading factor of traffic incidents.  Therefore, with self-driving cars, traffic incidents could eventually cease.  

I found the second con on the list to also be interesting and thought-provoking.  The cost of implementing this new technology would be very expensive.  At up to $100,000, it is unlikely that the majority of Americans could afford to make the switch to self-driving cars.  The only way for this trend to take off and be successful is if the majority people on the road are using this technology. ","Have you ever seen a driver texting on their phones, putting on lipstick, eating a sandwich, or drinking a coffee?  If you have spent time in a moving vehicle and driving, you are bound to have encountered of one these distracted drivers.  Chances are, you may have been the distracted driver at least once in your life.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are upwards of 33,000 fatalities from traffic incidents that occur on an annual basis.  The main cause of these incidents are - you guessed it - distracted driving.  Distracted driving can influence poor driving behaviors of speeding, failing to follow road laws, and driving while tired, drunk, or under the influence of drugs.  However, there are new developments in technology that allow a driver to be distracted.  This technology is self-driving cars. 

Self-driving cars present new possibilities for today's drivers.  As the cars are able to drive themselves, the driver would be able to fill wasted time in traffic or long commutes with productivity or leisurely activities.  Individuals with disabilities would have greater independence as those with physical disabilities or visual impairments would have greater mobility.  Additionally, elderly citizens would also be able to safely travel in their vehicles without worrying about any medical needs or memory loss. 

In addition to productivity, independence, and mobility, self-driving cars would prove to be cost effective.  Maximizing on gasoline usage, self-driving cars would produce less air pollution while saving the consumer money.  There would also be savings from money not being spent on older mass transit projects such as trains.  Car insurance may eventually fade, as the computer in the vehicle would be the one to make the decisions and would prevent car incidents.  

I understand, however, the technology in self-driving cars is still being developed.  The cost of implementing this new technology would be very expensive.  At up to $100,000 a vehicle, it is unlikely that the majority of Americans could afford to make the switch to self-driving cars.  The only way for this trend to take off and be successful is if the majority people on the road are using this technology. 

A computer in a self-driving car, with complicated algorithms and data that decreases the odds of a car accident, would not have the opportunity to become distracted.  As distracted driving is the leading factor of traffic incidents, traffic incidents could eventually cease because of self-driving cars.

Con number 7 highlighted how self-driving cars create an opportunity for hackers to compromise road safety. I found this pro interesting because I often find myself frustrated with sitting in slow or stopped traffic that I know could be improved if all the cars on the roadway could just drive in sync with one another. This con peaked my interest because computer hackers could wreak havoc if given a chance to hack into self-driving cars.","What once seemed like a faraway science fiction fantasy is now becoming a reality. Testing of self-driving cars is happening right here and now in our city of Pittsburgh. As technology advances and becomes ever more a part of our daily lives, we must consider the consequences of embracing the shiny and new. Though there are risks associated with adopting self-driving car technology into our society, the benefits of doing so greatly outweigh the risks.

Have you ever been trapped in an unnecessary traffic slowdown? Have you thought about how much time and gas you could save if the roadways and cars operated more efficiently and safely? Have you ever been concerned about public safety because of dangerous drivers who may be distracted, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or otherwise impaired? All of these problems could be solved with self-driving cars. The widespread use of self-driving cars could improve efficiency and safety of roadways, free up time and resources for members of society, and eliminate the human error that results in needless car accidents each year.

If self-driving cars ruled the roadway, your riding experience would be much more enjoyable. When self-driving cars communicate and work together on the road, they are able to improve traffic conditions and congestion. They are also able to identify road risks early on to avoid further frustration during your ride. The coordination between self-driving cars would make every passenger's ride more efficient, not to mention safer! Self-driving cars use advanced algorithms and technology to know when to brake, how to avoid obstacles, and how to maintain an optimum distance from surrounding cars, thus decimating the number of fender benders and other accidents between cars that happen on a daily basis. Some may express concern that with all of this advanced software comes an opportunity for hackers to take over and compromise safety on the road. Though this is a legitimate concern, it should be tempered with the knowledge that methods for hacking prevention are on the rise since this is a concern in all technological aspects of our lives like our personal computers and cell phones.

Self-driving cars also reduce commute times and would maximize gasoline usage. This would create more free time in the lives of drivers and passengers everywhere. Not only would it create time directly through commute reduction, but it would also potentially allow drivers to spend time in the car doing other things like reading or talking with other passengers, since their attention may not need to be on the road. It could be argued that drivers will still need to maintain focus while riding in self-driving cars. This may be true initially, but as the technology improves and becomes more widespread, passive driving will become a reality. Reduced costs associated with gasoline are just an added benefit for society!

When it comes down to it, human error is the source of difficulties with driving. Traffic, congestion, and car accidents are all a result of humans being imperfect drivers. Self-driving cars would take human error out of the picture, preventing distracted, intoxicated, or impaired drivers from causing fatal car accidents. Though there is always the small risk of mechanical failure to result in an accident, this risk is minute compared to the risk of humans being behind the wheel. 

Accepting new technology into our society should not be done hastily, but self-driving car technology is one that will improve our lives. With self-driving cars, we will have better driving experiences, we will have more time, and we will be safer.",
