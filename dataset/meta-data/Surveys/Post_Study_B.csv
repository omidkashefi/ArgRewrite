I think I disagreed with the above statement because while it DOES tell me what revisions I have made and whether those revisions are superficial or not, it cannot tell me WHY. Like, why might this sentence structure be bad, or why is this specific argument bad, or why I should find another passage to quote from, or how to improve, or how to have a better argument overall. I think this speaks to the fact that in general this program is super cool and super great and definitely helps with the overall structure of revisions (I think I would have totally used this for my own personal revisions), it could never be used to help weaknesses from a total writing standpoint.","Ummm, I think whatever sounded good? I think it also has to do with my method of editing (which isn't necessarily a good one) that I kind of read it top-to-bottom and see how it flows or where it's lacking.

I went back to the original text and found more information that could strengthen my writing. However, a few of the content revisions I made were marked as surface level. For instance, I added in that Google was the company making the cars, which I feel adds context and specificity, but that was considered surface level. Although I see how context revisions make the essay stronger, I also feel like surface level revisions, like grammar, are also very important and usually more frequent.
