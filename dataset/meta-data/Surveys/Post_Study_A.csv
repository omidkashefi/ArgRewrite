Personally, I did not feel like I was provided a whole lot of feedback or direction to write so I felt that my revisions were more limited than they otherwise may have been.",The only weakness really discussed in feedback was the suggestion of a stronger thesis. In revising my essays again I was also able to detect more grammatical errors.,Not typically as I often at most make one draft and then work off that. This was a more structured approach that I believe would be helpful if one is willing to put in the time.

Right now, it's no different than just having multiple documents open at once. It would be hard for a computer system to provide global feedback on organization, but it could perhaps be trained to find contrast words which are indicators of the inclusion of multiple points of view, and if there isn't a contrast word, it could alert the writer that they should consider including one. Transition in general could be checked to ensure organization. On a more line level, the system could check for overused language.","My experience led me to notice what needed to be revised. I am a professional writer, so I know what to look for even if I don't always execute as well as I could. Also, before doing the second draft, the feedback was good although I had already been aware of it. It was all the same feedback I would have provided to one of my students and I thought it was useful. Nothing about the system for the third revision was helpful.","No. I start with a blank screen so that I am not ""thinking inside the box.""

I think continuously having those revisions next to my writing would have served as a constant reminder. Additionally, the wording of the revisions seemed to me to be very snarky.
