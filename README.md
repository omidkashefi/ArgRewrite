# ArgRewrite V.2: an Annotated Argumentative Revisions Corpus

This repository contains the ArgRewrite V.2 corpus. ArgRewrite project evaluates the viability of revision as a pedagogical technique by determining whether student interactions with an NLP-based revision assistant enables them to learn to write better -- that is, whether certain forms of the feedback (in terms of the perceived purposes and scopes of changes) encourage students to learn to make more effective revisions. Please refer to [ArgRewrite Website](http://argrewrite.cs.pitt.edu/) for more details.

The following paper discusses the design, collection and annotation process of the ArgRewrite V.2 corpus:
